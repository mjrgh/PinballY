AX (ActiveX container window)
by Michael Courdakis, posted at www.codeproject.com
https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/18417/Use-an-ActiveX-control-in-your-Win-Project-witho

No explicit license terms are stated in the code.

[The AX code from the article served as the starting point for our
Shockwave Flash container, but the code here has been so customized
for our purposes that it no longer bears much resemblance to the
original.  For more general-purpose ActiveX container use, the Code
Project article is a much better starting point.]

Copyright (C) 1999-2018 Igor Pavlov.

This product includes the 7-Zip DLL (7z.dll) from the official Windows
distribution of 7-Zip.  We don't customize it at all, so we don't
build the DLL as part of our own build process; we just use the DLL
from the official binary distribution.

The source code for 7-Zip is available at http://www.7-zip.org.

  unRAR license restriction
  -------------------------

    The decompression engine for RAR archives was developed using source

    All copyrights to original unRAR code are owned by Alexander Roshal.

    The license for original unRAR code has the following restriction:

      The unRAR sources cannot be used to re-create the RAR compression algorithm,
      which is proprietary. Distribution of modified unRAR sources in separate form
      or as a part of other software is permitted, provided that it is clearly
      stated in the documentation and source comments that the code may
      not be used to develop a RAR (WinRAR) compatible archiver.
