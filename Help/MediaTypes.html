<h1>Media Types</h1>
<p>
   A Media Type is a data record inside PinballY that describes, in
   concrete programming terms, one of the media items that PinballY
   displays in its various windows.  There are media types defined
   for the main background media displayed in the different windows
   (playfield images and videos, backglass images and videos, etc),
   and for several types of supplemental media, such as advertising
   flyer images, instruction cards, and game wheel icons.  To a
   large extent, the built-in media types correspond to the standard
   media found in the HyperPin media packs distributed on
   the virtual pinball sites.
</p>
<p>
   In addition to the pre-defined media types that the system uses
   in its own windows, Javascript code can define additional,
   custom types.  This is done via <a href="GameList.html#createMediaType">GameList.createMediaType()</a>.
   Custom types are useful with <a href="CustomWindow.html">custom media windows</a> -
   new windows that you create through Javascript code, which appear alongside
   the standard windows and can perform the same function of displaying
   a particular kind of media associated with the selected game.
   Custom media types and custom media windows work together by
   letting you add new kinds of windows that act very much as
   though they were part of PinballY's standard window set.  You
   can also use custom media types for other purposes, such as
   adding new kinds of files for use in custom graphics.
</p>

<h2>Built-in media types</h2>
<p>
   Here's a list of the pre-defined media types built into PinballY.
   The <b>ID</b> gives the identifier that you use to refer to the
   media type in Javascript functions, such as
   <a href="GameInfo.html#resolveMedia"><i>gameInfo</i>.resolveMedia()</a>
   or <a href="MainWindowObject.html#createMediaWindow">mainWindow.createMediaWindow()</a>.
   The <b>Menu order</b> gives the sorting order when media types are listed
   in system menus; the media types included in a menu are arranged in
   ascending order of the <b>Menu order</b> number.
</p>
   
<table class="dataTable">
   <tr><th>ID</th><th>Description</th><th>Menu Order</th></tr>
   <tr><td>"bg image"</td><td>Backglass image</td><td>500</td></tr>
   <tr><td>"bg video"</td><td>Backglass video</td><td>510</td></tr>
   <tr><td>"dmd image"</td><td>DMD window image</td><td>600</td></tr>
   <tr><td>"dmd video"</td><td>DMD window video </td><td>610</td></tr>
   <tr><td>"flyer image"</td><td>Advertising flyer images</td><td>300</td></tr>
   <tr><td>"inst card image"</td><td>Instruction card images</td><td>200</td></tr>
   <tr><td>"launch audio"</td><td>Game launch audio</td><td>400</td></tr>
   <tr><td>"real dmd color image"</td><td>Real DMD image, for color DMD</td><td>810</td></tr>
   <tr><td>"real dmd color video"</td><td>Real DMD video, for color DMD</td><td>830</td></tr>
   <tr><td>"real dmd image"</td><td>Real DMD image, for monochrome DMD</td><td>800</td></tr>
   <tr><td>"real dmd video"</td><td>Real DMD video, for monochrome DMD</td><td>820</td></tr>
   <tr><td>"table audio"</td><td>Playfield audio track</td><td>430</td></tr>
   <tr><td>"table image"</td><td>Playfield image</td><td>410</td></tr>
   <tr><td>"table video"</td><td>Playfield video</td><td>420</td></tr>
   <tr><td>"topper image"</td><td>Topper window image</td><td>700</td></tr>
   <tr><td>"topper video"</td><td>Topper window video</td><td>710</td></tr>
   <tr><td>"wheel image"</td><td>Wheel icon</td><td>100</td></tr>
</table>


<h2>Custom media types</h2>

<p>
   You can use Javascript to create your own custom media types,
   adding to the types that PinballY knows about out of the box.
</p>
<p>
   To create a custom type, you call <a href="GameList.html#createMediaType">GameList.createMediaType(<i>desc</i>)</a>.
   <i>desc</i> is a descriptor object with properties that describe the
   new media type.
</p>
<p>
   Here are the properties you can use in the descriptor object <i>desc</i>.
   All of these are required except for the ones marked as optional.  
   An error will be thrown if any of the required properties are missing
   or use an invalid format.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>id:</b> A string giving the media type an ID that you'll use to refer
   to this type in subsequent Javascript operations involving media types.
   For example, this is the ID you use to refer to this media type when calling
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#createMediaWindow">mainWindow.createMediaWindow()</a>,
   in the <b>backgroundImageMediaType</b> and <b>backgroundVideoMediaType</b> properties
   of the window descriptor.
   <p>
      The only requirement for this type string is that it must be unique, so
      be sure it doesn't match the ID of any of the pre-defined types (see
      <a href="MediaTypes.html">Media Types</a> for the full list)
      or any other custom type you're using elsewhere in this script or any
      other scripts you're using.
   </p>

   <li><b>configId:</b> A string giving the ID for this media type to use in
   the settings file.  Like the <b>id</b>, this must be unique across all
   media types, since it has to uniquely identify the type when referenced
   in the settings file.  This identifier also has some limits on its syntax:
   it must not contain any spaces or punctuation marks except for periods,
   hyphens, and underscores.

   <li><b>name:</b> A string giving the friendly name to use for the media
   type when displaying it in a menu or elsewhere in the user interface.
   This can be anything you like, but something descriptive is of course
   ideal.  The system types render their display names in "title case"
   and in the plural, such as "Playfield Images" or "DMD Videos", so
   using a similar format will make your custom types harmonize better
   with the system types whenever they appear alongside them.

   <li><b>menuOrder:</b>  A number giving the placement of this item in menus
   where media types are listed.  Media types are arranged in ascending order
   of the <b>menuOrder</b> number when displayed in menus.  See
   <a href="MediaTypes.html">MediaTypes</a> for a list of the pre-defined
   types and their assigned menu order codes.  This is optional; if
   omitted, the system will assign an arbitrary order number that's
   higher than that of any of the built-in types.

   <li><b>folder:</b> A string giving the name of the sub-folder within
   the media folder tree where files of this type can be found.  This is
   the name of a Windows disk folder, so it has to conform to
   the usual Windows rules about file naming (for example, a number
   of special characters are forbidden, including quote marks, slashes,
   question marks, and asterisks).  This should be a plain folder name
   without any disk drive or path prefix, such as "Side Art Images".
   PinballY combines this with the standard media tree path to get
   the full path.
   <p>See <a href="DirectoryInfo.html">Files &amp; Folders</a>
      for details about how PinballY constructs full media path
      using this folder name.  The <b>folder</b> string defined here corresponds
      to the <b>&lt;Media type subfolder&gt;</b> portion of the
      full path in the explanations in that section.
   </p>

   <li><b>perSystem:</b> A boolean (true/false) value indicating whether
   there's a separate version of this type of media file for each game
   player system (Visual Pinball, Future Pinball, etc), or if there's
   a single global copy that applies to all systems.  <b>true</b> means
   that the files are stored individually for each game system, and <b>false</b>
   means that the files are "generic", with only one copy that's shared
   across all of the game systems.  The difference is described
   more fully in <a href="DirectoryInfo.html">Files &amp; Folders</a>.
   Optional; defaults to false (making the media type "generic").

   <li><b>format:</b>  A string indicating the broad format class that
   this type of media belongs to.  This must be one of the following,
   exactly as listed (including capitalization):
   <ul>
      <li><tt>"Image"</tt> - a still image, such as a JPEG or PNG file
      <li><tt>"SilentVideo"</tt> - a video without any audio track
      <li><tt>"Video"</tt> - a video with an audio track
      <li><tt>"VideoWithAudio"</tt> - same as <tt>"Video"</tt>
      <li><tt>"Audio"</tt> - an audio-only track, such as an MP3 or WAV file
   </ul>

   <li><b>extensions:</b>  A string with a list of filename suffixes
   (extensions) to search for when looking for files of this type.  List
   multiple extensions by separating each with a single space character.
   Each extension must start with a period (".").  For example, for
   image files, this might look like <tt>".jpg .jpeg .png .apng .gif"</tt>.

   <li><b>hasDropButton:</b>  A boolean (true/false) value indicating
   whether or not a "Drop File Here" button should be displayed in
   the main playfield window when dragging a file over the window.
   If you plan to create a <a href="CustomWindow.html">custom media window</a>
   based on this type, you probably <b>don't</b> want a drop button
   for the type in the main window, since you can drop media of
   this type directly on the dedicated custom window instead; that's
   more intuitive and avoids cluttering the main window.  If instead
   you intend for this type to be used for auxiliary purposes, rather
   than as a whole window backdrop, there won't be any "natural"
   place to drag and drop files of this type, so a main window
   button is useful.  This is how the built in Wheel Icon and
   Table Audio types work, since they don't have windows of
   their own where they could otherwise be dropped.  The
   default is false (no button) if the property isn't specified.

   <li><b>rotation:</b>  For images, this specifies the rotation
   that should be applied when loading the media files, in degrees
   clockwise.  This must be one of 0, 90, 180, or 270.  This is
   primarily for the sake of the convention used in all HyperPin
   media packs to store playfield images and videos rotated
   so that the bottom of the playfield appears at the left side
   of the image. 
   <p>
      This is optional; if omitted, a rotation of 0 is used, which renders
      the media as it appears in the file.  0 degrees is the right setting for
      almost all media files except for playfield images and videos,
      which use the HyperPin convention.
   </p>

   <li><b>isIndexed:</b>  A boolean saying if this is an "indexed" media
   type, meaning that it might have multiple copies of the item for the
   same game, with numeric suffixes (1, 2, 3...) on the filename.
   This is the convention used in HyperPin media packs for Instruction Card
   media, where you might have files named "Sinbad (Gottlieb 1978) 1.png",
   "Sinbad (Gottlieb 1978) 2.png", etc.
   Optional; defaults to false.

   <li><b>pageFolders:</b>  An array of strings, giving the names of subfolders
   of the media type's main folder (the one named by the <b>folder</b> property)
   used to store "pages" of the media.  This is how the "Flyers" (scans of the
   original advertising material) in HyperPin media packs are organized.  None
   of the other built-in media types apart from Flyers use this; all of the
   others just use a single file with no additional "page" structure (except
   for Instruction Cards, which uses the "indexed" scheme described above
   under the <b>isIndexed</b> property).
   Optional; if not provided, the media type simply uses a single file per game,
   without any added "page folder" tree.

   <li><b>captureStartConfigVar:</b> The name of the configuration variable
   (used in the Settings.txt file) where the trigger mode to use to start image/video
   capture for this media type is stored.  As with all configuration variables,
   this should be limited to alphanumeric characters and periods, hyphens,
   and underscores.  Optional.

   <li><b>captureStopConfigVar:</b> The name of the configuration variable
   where the trigger mode to end video capture for this media type is stored.
   Optional.

   <li><b>captureTimeConfigVar:</b> The name of the configuration variable
   where the video capture time for this media type is stored.
   Optional.

</ul>
<p>
   Calling the method creates a new media type based on the descriptor, and
   adds it to the system's internal list of types.  You can use it from Javascript
   from that point forward by referencing the <b>id</b> string you provided.
</p>
<p>
   The method has no return value.  This might seem a little strange, since
   "creating" something usually returns an object representing that thing.
   In this case, there's no Javascript object representing the newly created media type;
   a media type is just an internal list entry within PinballY.  In Javascript contexts where
   you need to refer to a media type, you do so using the <b>id</b>
   string you provided in the descriptor.
