<h1>Files &amp; Folders</h1>

<p>
   PinballY stores a bunch of files to keep track of your list of
   games and their media files.  Ideally, you shouldn't have to know
   anything about these files or where they're stored, because PinballY
   tries to make all of its internal storage details as invisible as
   possible.  But "invisible" is only good when things are working.
   It backfires when something goes wrong, because it's hard to troubleshoot
   what you can't see.  
</p>
<p>
   So, for the sake of troubleshooting, this section gives you the
   details on where PinballY stores its various files.   Hopefully, this
   will let you figure out what PinballY is thinking when looking for
   a particular file, so that you can figure out why PinballY can't find
   it, is finding the wrong copy, or whatever else seems to be wrong.

<h2>Media Files</h2>

<p>
   PinballY uses the same media folder structure that HyperPin and
   PinballX use, to make it easier to use existing files that
   you already have installed from one of those programs.  The
   folder structure is hierarchical - folders within folders -
   and each level of the folder path comes from a different
   option setting that you can change.
</p>
<p>
   The basic hierarchical path for a media file looks like this:
</p>
<div class="indented" style="font-weight: bold;">
   &lt;Main media folder&gt;\&lt;Per-system subfolder&gt;\&lt;Media type subfolder&gt;
</div>
<p>
   Within those folders, each game has a media file named according
   to the games title, manufacturer, and year.  Read on for where all
   of these different pieces come from.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Main media folder:</b>  All media files are stored within
   the main Media folder, which you can configure via your settings
   (see <a href="PathOptions.html">Folder Options</a>).  You
   can choose a specific folder location in the settings if you wish, but
   I'd recommend using the default setting.  Here's how the default
   setting works:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>If PinballX is installed on your system, the main media
      folder is <b>&lt;PinballX install folder&gt;\Media</b>

   <li>Otherwise, it's <b>&lt;PinballY install folder&gt;\Media</b>
</ul>

<p>
   <b>Per-system media folders:</b>  Each "system" (that is, pinball player
   program, like Visual Pinball 9 or Future Pinball) has its own
   subfolder under this main media folder.  By default, this folder has
   the same name as the system, but you can set it for each
   system individually using the options dialog.
</p>
<p>
   For example, Visual Pinball 9's system folder might be
   <b>&lt;PinballX install folder&gt;\Media\Visual Pinball 9</b>.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Media type folders:</b>  Each "media type" has its own
   subfolder.  Things get a little hairy(ier) here, because some
   media types are "generic", meaning that they're not differentiated
   by system, and others are system-specific.  I probably wouldn't
   have made this distinction if it weren't already the way that
   PinballX and HyperPin did it, but I carried it over for the sake
   of compatibility; such is the cost of easy migration.
</p>
<p>
   The "generic" media types have their type folders directly under
   the main Media folder.  These are as follows:
</p>

<style type="text/css">
.mediaFolderList span {
    font: 90% Georgia;
    font-style: italic;
    color: #606060;
    margin-left: 1em;
}
</style>

<ul class="singleSpace mediaFolderList">
   <li>Media\Company Logos <span>(PNG files with manufacturer logos: Williams, Gottlieb, etc)</span>
   <li>Media\Flyer Images  <span>(pictures of promotional flyers for the games)</span>
   <ul class="singleSpace">
      <li>Front
      <li>Inside1
      <li>Inside2
      <li>Inside3
      <li>Inside5
      <li>Inside6
      <li>Back
   </ul>
   <li>Media\Instruction Cards
   <li>Media\System Logos <span>(PNG files with game system logos: Visual Pinball, etc)</span>
</ul>

<p>
   Note that the Flyer Images folder has its own subfolders, which
   store the individual pages of the flyers, one page per image and
   one image per folder.
</p>

<p>
   The system-specific media types are nested under the system
   folder for each system:
</p>
<ul class="singleSpace">
   <li>Media\&lt;system folder&gt;\Backglass Images
   <li>Media\&lt;system folder&gt;\Backglass Videos
   <li>Media\&lt;system folder&gt;\DMD Images
   <li>Media\&lt;system folder&gt;\DMD Videos
   <li>Media\&lt;system folder&gt;\Launch Audio
   <li>Media\&lt;system folder&gt;\Real DMD Color Images
   <li>Media\&lt;system folder&gt;\Real DMD Color Videos
   <li>Media\&lt;system folder&gt;\Real DMD Images
   <li>Media\&lt;system folder&gt;\Real DMD Videos
   <li>Media\&lt;system folder&gt;\Table Audio
   <li>Media\&lt;system folder&gt;\Table Images
   <li>Media\&lt;system folder&gt;\Table Videos
   <li>Media\&lt;system folder&gt;\Topper Images
   <li>Media\&lt;system folder&gt;\Topper Videos
   <li>Media\&lt;system folder&gt;\Wheel Images
</ul>

<p>
   The &lt;system folder&gt; path element is replaced by the "Media Subfolder"
   name for the system, which you can view and change via the options dialog.
   The default subfolder name is the same as the system's name (e.g., "Visual Pinball"
   or "Future Pinball").
</p>

<p>
   <b>Media files for each game:</b>
   The media files for a game (the playfield image, backglass image, etc) 
   are distributed among the media folders listed above according to their
   function: the main playfield image goes in the Table Images folder, the
   backglass video goes in Backglass Images, and so on.
</p>
<p>
   Within those folders, all of the files for a given game have the same
   name, based on the game's "Media Name" setting.  By default, when you
   first set up a new game, the Media Name is set based on this pattern:
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
   Game Title (Manufacturer Year)
</div>

<p>
   For example, for <i>Funhouse</i>, the media name might be set
   by default to <b>Funhouse (Williams 1990)</b>.
   PinballY uses that default pattern for the Media Name because it's
   the pattern used by HyperPin and PinballX.
</p>
<p>
   You can also override the Media Name for each game, by setting
   a different setting in the <a href="EditGameDetails.html">Game
   Details</a> dialog.
</p>
<p>
   Once you know the Media Name for the game, you can easily figure
   out the names for all of the game's media files.  They all use
   the base Media Name plus an appropriate file type suffix
   (extension).  For example, for a JPEG file, you'd take the
   base Media Name and add <b>.jpg</b>, the standard suffix for
   any JPEG file.  So if the Media Name is <b>Funhouse (Williams 1990)</b>,
   a JPEG playfield image would be called <b>Funhouse (Williams 1990).jpg</b>.
   The backglass and DMD images for Funhouse could have <i>exactly the same name</i>,
   since the naming pattern is based purely on the Media Name.  The
   way you tell these files apart is by their folder location.
</p>
<p>
   To display the exact Media Name used for a game's media files,
   select the "Information" command in the main menu to bring up the
   game info box.  The base media filename is displayed in the box.
   You can also get a full list of the specific media files that
   PinballY found for the current game, with full names and folder
   locations, using the "Show Media Files" command in the Game
   Setup Menu (reachable from the Operator Menu).
</p>
<p>
   Why we use this crazy "same name for everything" format:
   Blame history.
   This scheme of using the same name for multiple files might
   seem rather confusing, especially when you're
   trying to manage the files manually in Windows Explorer.  It
   might seem more logical to use different names for each file.
   I'd completely agree.  But the reason we do it this way is
   that there's a large collection of existing files out there
   that already use this scheme.  This format became so widely used for
   media packs on the Web because it's the format that HyperPin
   used.  HyperPin was the original front end, and the only one
   around for many years, so it quickly became the standard format
   by default.  When PinballX came along, it used the same format
   for the sake of compatibility, so that people could use all of
   those existing media pack files from HyperPin.  We're continuing
   the tradition for the same reason.

<h3>Default media files</h3>

<p>
   Okay, we've seen how PinballY looks for the media files for a
   given game.  But what happens when there isn't a matching file?
   In this case, PinballY displays a <b>default</b> media file,
   which acts as a placeholder for missing game media.  PinballY
   comes with a set of <i>default</i> default files, which you can
   replace those with your own images and videos if you prefer.
</p>
<p>
   There are actually two layers of default files: per-system
   defaults, which apply to all games built with a given system
   (for example, a default backglass for all Visual Pinball 9
   tables); and global defaults, which serve as the last-resort
   fallback for all games.  The per-system default media files
   are always preferred when they're present, and the global
   defaults are used when no system default files are available.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Per-system default media:</b>  Default videos and images that
   you want to supply for a particular system go in the following
   folders:
</p>
<div class="indented" style="font-weight: bold;">
   &lt;Main media folder&gt;\&lt;System folder&gt;\Default Videos<br>
   &lt;Main media folder&gt;\&lt;System folder&gt;\Default Images<br>
</div>
<p>
   Within these folders, create any combination of the following files,
   which are used in the respective windows:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   <b>No Back Glass</b>.<i>ext</i><br>
   <b>No DMD</b>.<i>ext</i><br>
   <b>No Instruction Card</b>.<i>ext</i><br>
   <b>No Topper</b>.<i>ext</i><br>
   <b>No Custom Window Media</b>.<i>ext</i>
</div>
<p>
   The extensions (<i>.ext</i>) are the usual set of
   <a href="#allFormats">supported format
   extensions</a> for images and video files: .png, .jpg, .mp4, etc.
   ("No Custom Window Media" is used for custom windows created through
   Javascript; see <a href="Custom Media Window">Custom Media Windows</a>
   for details.)
</p>
<p>
   For example, here's how you'd name a default video for the backglass
   window for Visual Pinball 9 games (assuming that your VP9 media folder
   is called "Visual Pinball 9"):
</p>
<div class="indented">
   &lt;Main media folder&gt;\Visual Pinball 9\Default Videos\No Backglass.mp4
</div>
<p>
   Note that the folder and file naming conventions for the per-system
   default media files are the same that PinballX uses, so if you're
   already set up these sorts of defaults for PinballX, they should
   carry over without any changes.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Global default media:</b>  When a game doesn't
   provide its own media files, and there aren't even any per-system
   default files, PinballY looks for a global default video or image.
   PinballY comes with a set of default image files, but you can
   supersede these with your own video or image files if you have
   nicer-looking ones that you prefer.
</p>
<p>
   The custom global default files go in the following folders:
</p>
<div class="indented" style="font-weight: bold;">
   &lt;Main media folder&gt;\Images<br>
   &lt;Main media folder&gt;\Videos<br>
</div>
<p>
   Within those folders, the default files for the individual
   windows have the following filenames:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   <b>Default Backglass</b>.<i>ext</i><br>
   <b>Default DMD</b>.<i>ext</i><br>
   <b>Default Instruction Card</b>.<i>ext</i><br>
   <b>Default Topper</b>.<i>ext</i>
</div>
<p>
   <b>PinballY defaults:</b>  If you don't provide your own global default
   media files as described above, PinballY falls back on its own
   default images as a last resort.  These are stored the <b>Assets</b>
   folder within your main PinballY install folder.  Within Assets,
   the same subfolders and default image file names are used
   as in the global default media folders (Images\Default Backglass.png, etc).
</p>
<p>
   Note that you <b>shouldn't</b> customize by replacing the files in
   the Assets folder, since PinballY thinks of those as its own, and
   thus might feel free to modify them on future updates.  Always
   use the Media folder locations above for your customizations instead.
</p>

<h3>Creating separate PinballY and PinballX default images</h3>

<p>
   This is an advanced topic that will only be interesting to you
   if you're planning to run <i>both</i> PinballX <i>and</i> PinballY
   on an ongoing basis, so that you can switch back and forth between
   the two.
</p>
<p>
   If you're planning to continue using both programs, you're probably
   sharing the media files between both programs, by keeping everything
   in PinballX's media folder tree, and telling PinballY to use the
   media from PinballX's folder.  In this case, PinballY has a special
   feature that lets you override just the default media files, while
   keeping all of the other files shared.  That gives you the ability
   to give PinballY a slightly different, custom look, at least when
   default backgrounds are involved.
</p>
<p>
   The trick is to place your default images and videos in the
   <b>PinballY\Media</b> tree rather than in the PinballX media
   tree.  In the sections above where we started a path with the
   <b>&lt;Main media folder&gt;</b>, you'd just replace that portion of
   the path with <b>&lt;PinballY install folder&gt;\Media</b>.
   Everything else stays the same.  
</p>
<p>
   Here's how this "override" feature works.  For the various default
   media items, PinballY always searches in its own PinballY\Media folder
   before checking your "Main" media folder from your settings.  If it
   finds the file it's looking for in the PinballY\Media, it uses that
   one; otherwise, it repeats the search in the main media folder.  So
   if you're sharing media from the PinballX media folder tree, this
   ensures that a PinballY "override" is found first and used instead.
   If you don't want to overide anything, you don't have to, since
   the files in your main media folder are still used by default.

<a name="tableDatabases"></a>
<h2>Table Databases</h2>

<p>
   PinballY keeps track of the games displayed in the "game wheel"
   via a set of table database files.  These files use the conventions
   used by HyperPin and PinballX, because we wanted you to be able to
   use your existing files if you already had one of those systems
   previously installed.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Main table database folder location:</b>
   The table databases are all stored within
   the main Table Databases folder, which you can configure via your
   settings (see <a href="PathOptions.html">Folder Options</a>).
   You can choose a specific folder location in the settings
   if you wish, but I'd recommend using the default setting.  Here's
   how the default setting works:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>If PinballX is installed on your system, the main table database
      folder is <b>&lt;PinballX install folder&gt;\Databases</b>

   <li>Otherwise, it's <b>&lt;PinballY install folder&gt;\Databases</b>
</ul>
<p>
   <b>System folders:</b>  Each "system" (that is, pinball player
   program, like Visual Pinball 9 or Future Pinball) has its own
   subfolder under this main database folder.  By default, a
   system folder has the same name as the system, but you can
   set it for each system individually using the options dialog.
</p>
<p>
   So, for example, the system folder for Visual Pinball 9 might be
   <b>&lt;PinballX install folder&gt;\Databases\Visual Pinball 9</b>.
</p>
<p>
   <b>XML files:</b>  Finally, we come to the actual files!  Each table
   database file is an XML file.  You'll find one or more of these
   in the system folder for each system.
</p>
<p>
   Each system has one "main" XML file.  This is the "main" file because
   it has the exact same name as the system folder, plus of course
   the .xml suffix.  For example, the Visual Pinball 9 main file might be
   <b>&lt;PinballX install folder&gt;\Databases\Visual Pinball 9\Visual Pinball 9.xml</b>.
</p>
<p>
   In addition to the "main" file, you can have any number of additional
   .xml files with other names.  PinballX used these files to represent
   "lists", which is PinballX's version of a category.  PinballY 
   recognizes these files and treats them as categories as well, so
   that your existing PinballX data gets treated the same way in PinballY.
   PinballY automatically creates a category for each .xml file it finds
   apart from the "main" file for each system.  All known categories are
   available as filters in the main menu, so that you can limit the
   view to games in a given category.
</p>
<p>
   Apart from the category identification, PinballY treats all of the XML
   files in a single system folder as one big list of that system's games.
   So the games that you should see listed in the "game wheel" for a
   given system should be the combination of all of the contents of
   all of the XML files in that system's database folder.
</p>
<p>
   The XML files follow the HyperPin and PinballX XML format, which looks
   like this:
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;menu&gt;
        &lt;game name="Hot_Shot"&gt;
            &lt;description&gt;Hot Shot (Gottlieb 1973)&lt;/description&gt;
            &lt;rom&gt;&lt;/rom&gt;
            &lt;manufacturer&gt;Gottlieb&lt;/manufacturer&gt;
            &lt;year&gt;1973&lt;/year&gt;
            &lt;type&gt;EM&lt;/type&gt;
            &lt;hidedmd&gt;True&lt;/hidedmd&gt;
            &lt;hidetopper&gt;True&lt;/hidetopper&gt;
            &lt;hidebackglass&gt;True&lt;/hidebackglass&gt;
            &lt;enabled&gt;True&lt;/enabled&gt;
            &lt;rating&gt;3.5&lt;/rating&gt;
        &lt;/game&gt;
    &lt;/menu&gt;
</pre>

<p>
   It's better not to edit these files by hand, since it's easy to
   miss a &lt; or &gt; or otherwise mess up the rigid XML format.
   It's better to edit the game information via the Game Setup dialog,
   which you can access from the Operator Menu in the program.
   But these files are pretty easy to read, so it's helpful to
   know where they are, and to be able to take a look inside,
   if you're trying to troubleshoot a problem.  You can view
   their contents with any text editor.
</p>

<h3>Table file name</h3>
<p>
   The &lt;game name="xxx"&gt; field in the XML specifies the table
   file name.  This must not include a directory/folder path, since
   the system uses the system settings to determine the directory
   location for table files.  The player system's filename suffix 
   is optional (e.g., <b>.vpx</b> for Visual Pinball 10 games),
   but it's usually omitted.
</p>

<h3>Game title</h3>
<p>
   The title of the game that's displayed in the wheel UI comes
   from the &lt;description&gt; field.  This should use the
   format <b>Title (Manufacturer 1980)</b>, where <b>1980</b>
   is the release year.
</p>
<p>
   Why do we include the manufacturer and release year in the
   &lt;description&gt; field, when they're also specified
   separately in the &lt;manufacturer&gt; and &lt;year&gt; fields?
   Because that's the way HyperPin and PinballX do it.  PinballY
   generates its XML using the same redundant format so that
   those other programs will still be able to read the XML.
   And PinballY accepts the redundant information when reading
   the files, so that you can directly use XML files that were
   originally created for the other programs.  PinballY will
   also accept &lt;description&gt; text that only has the title,
   using the separate XML fields to get the manufacturer and
   release year data.  However, it's better to use the
   full form, because that's more compatible with the other
   programs (in case you ever want to switch), and it will also
   avoid any ambiguity if the game title itself happens to contain
   a parenthetical at the end.
</p>
<p>
   If there's no &lt;description&gt; field, the filename from
   the &lt;game name="xxx"&gt; attribute will be used as the
   display title.
</p>


<a name="gameStatsCsv"></a>
<h2>Table Statistics</h2>

<p>
   In addition to the table database files above, PinballY keeps a separate
   collection of information on tables in a file called <b>GameStats.csv</b>,
   in the main PinballY install folder.  This file stores additional
   information on the tables beyond what the HyperPin/PinballX 
   database format can store.
</p>
<p>
   This file is in an all-text format, so you can view it with any text
   editor, but it uses a structured format that makes it kind of hard
   to read (and I definitely wouldn't recommend editing it by hand).
   The file uses the CSV (comma-separated value) format, which was
   designed for data exchange between programs like spreadsheets and
   database managers that work with tabular data.  If you do want to
   view it, the first line of the file gives a list of column names
   that describe the structure of the data, and each line after that
   is a "database row" that contains the data for one game, in the
   column format described by that first column name line.
</p>
<p>
   If you want to import the GameStats.csv file into another program
   or convert it to a different format, you'll need to know which
   CSV parameters it uses, since CSV files come in several varieties.
   We use commas as field separators, double quote marks (") as quotes,
   and stuttered quotes ("") for embedded quotes in values.  With
   those parameters set properly, you can mechanically translate
   CSV into just about any other format.
</p>

<p>
   (It would have been nicer to store everything about a game in one
   place, namely the XML database file.  There are two reasons we don't.
   The first is that we wanted to maintain the greatest degree of
   compatibility possible between the PinballY and HyperPin/PinballX
   databases, so that you can switch between the programs easily.
   So we didn't want to add anything to the XML files that the other
   programs wouldn't understand, to avoid confusing them or making
   them unable to read the files.  We therefore only use the XML
   files for the metadata that the other programs already store
   there.  The second reason is that XML entries only exist for
   "configured" games, where you've manually set up the metadata.
   PinballY, unlike the other front ends, lets you see all of your
   table files in its wheel UI.  So we needed a separate place to
   store information about unconfigured games.)
</p>


<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>
   All of PinballY's option settings are in the file <b>Settings.txt</b>,
   stored in the main PinballY install folder.  This is a human-readable,
   plain text file that you can peruse and edit by hand if you wish.
   You shouldn't need to edit options this way, because all of the options
   are configurable through the program (via the Options dialog or via
   various menus), but it can be handy for troubleshooting purposes
   because it lets you see all of your settings in one place.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Resetting to defaults:</b>
   If you think you've done something to muck up your settings beyond
   repair, and you want to restore the original factory defaults,
   simply delete Settings.txt.  There's no need to uninstall the program
   if you just want to reset the options, since all of the changeable
   settings are in that single Settings.txt file.
</p>

<h2>Windows Registry</h2>

<p>
   PinballY stores nothing of its own in the Windows Registry.  The
   registry is such a source of misery for other software that I try
   to avoid it entirely.
</p>
<p>
   However, if you install via the Windows SETUP installer using the
   .msi download, the installer places two keys in the registry.
   These keys are purely for SETUP's use, and aren't used by PinballY
   itself, so deleting or changing them won't have any effect on
   normal program operation.  They're also unique to PinballY, so
   they won't affect any other programs.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\{XXXXX}:</b>
   This Microsoft installer system uses this key to record an "Uninstall" entry,
   which the Windows "Add or Remove Programs" control panel uses to show you a
   list of installed programs.
   <p>
      The <b>{XXXXX}</b> part is randomly generated for each PinballY version,
      so it changes on each version.  It's a long sequence of characters (hexadecimal
      digits, to be more precise) in curly braces, known as a GUID (Globally
      Unique IDentifier).  This is Microsoft's way of uniquely identifying
      program versions.  Unfortunately, being random, it has no relationship
      to the nominal program version, so there's no way to determine it other
      than to search the registry.  The easiest way to find it is to open RegEdit,
      navigate to the parent key (...\Uninstall), press Ctrl+F to bring up
      a search box, and type in <b>PinballY</b>.  That will find the key
      via its <b>DisplayName</b> property, which the installer will have set to
      "PinballY".
   </p>
   <p>
      If you're running the 32-bit version of PinballY on a 64-bit Windows system,
      the key will have a slightly different name, due to the way Windows
      segregates 32-bit and 64-bit applications:
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\{XXXXX}
   </p>

   <li><b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Pinscape Labs\PinballY:</b>  This key stores
   the folder where you installed PinballY via its <b>InstallPath</b> property.
   The installer uses this so that it can pre-select the same folder as the
   default the <i>next</i> time you install a new version of PinballY.  This
   is just to save you a little typing on future updates.  PinballY doesn't
   use this during normal program operations, so it doesn't matter whether
   or not it's in sync with your current setup; it's purely for the next
   install, to save a little typing when selecting the install location.

</ul>

<h2>Task Scheduler</h2>

<p>
   If you enable automatic program launch at startup via the Options dialog,
   PinballY will create a system Task Scheduler task called "PinballY Startup Task".
   This will appear in the top-level group of system tasks, which you can view by
   running the Windows Task Scheduler control panel: press Windows+R and type
   <b>taskschd.msc</b> into the Run box.
</p>
<p>
   You can modify or delete the PinballY startup task using the Task Scheduler
   control panel.  It's better to let PinballY manage it, so that you don't
   accidentally make a change that makes the task stop working, but it's
   perfectly safe to simply delete the task if you want to turn off the
   automatic launch.
