<h1>Pinball Player System Setup</h1>

<p>
   This dialog lets you configure your pinball player systems, such as Visual
   Pinball and Future Pinball, for use with PinballY.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY tries to be as "system agnostic" as possible, so it tries to
   avoid hard-coded special handling for any one system.  Instead, it gives
   you a big collection of tunable options that you can tailor to each
   system.  The downside is that it makes the setup dialog pretty complex;
   it might look a little daunting when you first bring it up just because
   there are so many options.  But it's not as bad as it looks at first
   glance, because you can leave many of the options blank in most cases.
   PinballY will try to choose a suitable default for anything you leave
   blank.
</p>

<h2>Adding a new system</h2>

<p>
   To add a new system, click on the "Systems" item in the list on the
   left, then click the "Add a new system" button.  This will create a
   new system page that you can fill in with the system's details.
</p>
<p>
   For help with figuring out those "details" actually are for a
   new system, read through <a href="NewSystemSetup.html">New system setup</a>.
   (You might also need to read through the material below
   for some of the finer points of the individual options.)
</p>

<h2>Migrating from PinballX</h2>

<p>
   If you've already set up PinballX on your system, and you've already
   gone through the process of setting up its list of tables and installing
   media packs, you can use all of those existing table lists and media files
   in PinballY without moving or copying any files.  (So it's not really
   "migrating" in the usual sense - you don't have to go through any
   conversion process.)  All you have to do is make sure that the
   <b>System name</b> settings in your PinballY setup match those in your
   PinballX setup.  PinballX keys all of the folder locations for its table
   database and media files to the system name, so PinballY will find the
   same files as long as you set all of the system names the same way.
</p>
<p>
   The system naming is <i>usually</i> the same by default, so matching
   them can be practically invisible and automatic.  However, there's
   one place where it's easy to get hung up: <b>version numbers</b>.
   Most people have a slew of different Visual Pinball versions installed,
   because many of the VP versions are incompatible with each other's files.
   So pay close attention to the system names for
   the different VP versions.  Here are the default system names
   that PinballY uses for VP 9 and VP 10 (aka VPX):
</p>
<table class="dataTable">
   <tr><th>Program</th><th>Default system name in PinballY</th></tr>
   <tr><td>Visual Pinball 9.x</td><td>"Visual Pinball"</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Visual Pinball 10</td><td>"Visual Pinball X"</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
   Those are the defaults because that's how a lot of
   people have things set up in PinballX.  If your PinballX setup is
   the same, the files will all be shared automatically.  But some people
   have their PinballX system settings sort of the opposite, with
   the PinballX system name for VP 10 set to "Visual Pinball", and
   VP 9 set to "Visual Pinball 9".  If that's how you set up PinballX,
   you can see how this is going to create confusion for PinballY:
   PinballY is going to think that "Visual Pinball" means
   VP 9, so it's going to try to use VP 9 for all of your VP 10 games.
</p>
<p>
   If you run into this, it's really easy to fix.  The easiest way to go
   to the system settings dialog and change the system names in PinballY
   to match your PinballX settings.  PinballY doesn't have any hard-coded
   assumptions about what the various systems are called, so you're free
   to rename them as needed.  The other way is to go into the system
   settings for each system and set explicit folder paths for the
   <b>Media Folder</b> and <b>Database Folder</b>.  By default, those
   simply use the system name that you've entered, which is the same
   convention that PinballX uses.  But PinballY lets you override
   them individually if you want to look in other folders.
</p>

<h2>Settings for all systems</h2>

<p>
   Some of the settings are handled the same way for all types of
   player systems:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>System name:</b> Enter a name of your choice here, as this
   is used mostly for display purposes in the user interface.  If
   you're migrating from PinballX, and you want to use the same
   media and table list files, you should make sure this matches
   the name used in your PinballX settings.
   <p>
      If you want to share files with PinballX, be sure to use
      the <b>exact</b> same names as in your PinballX setup.
      Pay particular attention to <b>version numbers</b>
      for Visual Pinball versions.  When you first install PinballY,
      its default settings use the plain name "Visual Pinball"
      (with no version number) for VP <b>9</b> - VP 10 is called
      "Visual Pinball X" in the default settings.  If your
      PinballX setup uses "Visual Pinball" as the name for VP X,
      you should change the PinballY settings to match.
   </p>

   <li><b>Enable:</b> Check this box to enable the system; un-check
   it to disable it.  Disabling a system prevents any of its games
   from appearing in the user interface, so it's effectively like
   deleting the system from your configuration entirely, except that
   it lets you keep the settings around in case you want to restore
   them in the future.

   <li><b>Media folder:</b>  This is name of the <b>sub-folder</b> (within the main
   PinballX or PinballY media folder tree) where the image, video,
   and sound files for this system's games are stored.
   <p>
      If you leave this blank, the System Name is used as the default folder name.
      That's the best choice in most cases.
   </p>
   <p>
      Important: enter only a sub-folder name, <b>not</b> a full path with
      a drive letter.  This sub-folder is always within the main Media folder,
      which you can set separately in the <a href="PathOptions.html">Folder Options</a>
      page.
   </p>

   <li><b>Database folder:</b>  This is the name of the <b>sub-folder</b>
   (within the main PinballX or PinballY database folder tree) where the
   game listing files for this system are located.
   <p>
      If you leave this blank, the System Name is used as the default folder name.
      That's the best choice in most cases.
   </p>
   <p>
      Important: as with the Media folder, enter only a sub-folder name,
      <b>not</b> a full path with a drive letter.  This sub-folder
      is always within the main Table Database folder, which you can set
      separately in the <a href="PathOptions.html">Folder Options</a>
      page.
   </p>

   <li><b>Keep these PinballY windows open:</b>  These checkboxes let
   you tell PinballY to continue displaying graphics and videos in
   the selected windows while games based on this system are running.
   See <a href="#keepWindowsOpen">below</a> for more details.

</ul>

<a name="standardRecipes"></a>
<h2>Recipes for the common systems</h2>

<p>
   The basic settings for the most common systems are listed below.
   Apart from the "System Name", "Media Folder", and "Database Folder",
   you should simply leave any fields not mentioned in the recipes blank.
</p>
<p>
   You can set the System Name to any name you'd like, with a couple of
   simple constraints:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>It should be unique (not the same as any other system in your settings)
   <li>If you're migrating from PinballX, and you want to use your existing
   PinballX database and media files, be sure to use the same name used
   in the PinballX settings for this system
</ul>

<p>
   The Media Folder and Database Folder boxes can usually be left blank,
   in which case PinballY uses the System Name as the default folder name
   for each item.  You only need to enter names into these boxes if you
   want to override this default for some reason.
</p>

<h3>Visual Pinball 8/9</h3>

<p>
   <b>System class:</b> Visual Pinball 9 or earlier<br>
   <b>Program EXE:</b> leave blank (see below)<br>
   <b>Parameters:</b>  /play -"[TABLEPATH]\[TABLEFILE]"<br>
   <b>Window Mode:</b> Minimize<br>
   <b>Table folder:</b> Tables<br>
   <b>Table extension:</b> .vpt<br>
</p>
<p>
   For the <b>Program EXE</b> box, if you leave it blank, PinballY will
   use the Visual Pinball executable that's assigned for <tt>.vpt</tt> files in
   the Windows registry.  This only works if you have only one version
   of VP installed, and you ran the VP SETUP program to set up the
   file associations in the registry.  If the .vpt file associations
   aren't set up, you'll have to enter the full path to the Visual
   Pinball .exe file; you can click the little folder icon button next
   to the Program EXE box to browse for the file.
</p>
<p>
   Many people keep multiple versions of VP 8-9 installed at the same
   time.  In this case, Windows only allows one of them to be associated
   with .vpt files, so the "leave it blank" advice will only work for
   that one version that's assigned in the registry.  For the other
   versions, you'll have to specify the version of VPinballXXX.exe
   to use.  For example, if you have both VP 9.2 and VP 9.9 installed
   (as many people do), follow this procedure:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Create two separate "system" pages, one for VP 9.2 and one for 9.9
   <li>In the VP 9.2 page, set the Program EXE box to VPinball921.exe
   (or whichever version is current)
   <li>In the VP 9.9 page, set the Program EXE box to VPinball995.exe
   (or whichever version is current)
</ul>
<p>
   You can repeat that procedure to create additional system pages
   for any other VP versions that you have installed.  Note that the
   default settings when you first install PinballY come with entries
   already filled in for VP 9.2, VP 9.9, and VP 10, so you probably
   won't have to create those yourself.  But you can create as many
   additional entries as you need.
</p>
<p>
   In the system settings lists below, type all of the text
   literally as shown, even when you see special characters like
   [square brackets] or "quotes".

<h3>Visual Pinball X</h3>

<p>
   <b>System class:</b> Visual Pinball 10<br>
   <b>Program EXE:</b> leave blank<br>
   <b>Parameters:</b>  /minimized /play -"[TABLEPATH]\[TABLEFILE]"<br>
   <b>Window Mode:</b> Minimize<br>
   <b>Table folder:</b> Tables<br>
   <b>Table extension:</b> .vpx<br>
</p>

<a name="VP-with-PinUp"></a>
<h3>Visual Pinball with PinUp Player</h3>

<p>
   PinUp Player is an add-on for Visual Pinball and other systems that displays
   videos in secondary windows during the game.</p>
<p>
   In principle, PinUp Player shouldn't require anything extra in the PinballY options.
   It should just act like a part of your VP games, so as far as PinballY is concerned,
   the system setup recipe for VP+PinUp is exactly the same as the recipe for VP.
</p>
<p>
   However, there is a common problem that a lot of people run into using VP+PinUp, which is
   that the PinUp windows might stubbornly stay open after Visual Pinball terminates.
   This is usually due to a problem in the VP table scripts, so it usually only affects
   certain tables, and can usually be fixed by editing the table scripts.
   If you're experiencing this problem, please read the <a href="Troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a>
   section under <a href="Troubleshooting.html#PinUpIsntExiting">PinUp Player doesn't close</a>.

</p>


<h3>The Pinball Arcade (Farsight)</h3>

<p>
   <b>System class:</b> STEAM<br>
   <b>Program EXE:</b> [STEAM]<br>
   <b>Parameters:</b> -applaunch 238260<br>
   <b>Window Mode:</b> Minimize<br>
   <b>Process name:</b> PinballArcade.exe<br>
   <b>Table folder:</b> [PinballY]\Farsight<br>
   <b>Table extension:</b> .pinballArcade<br>
   <b>Startup Keys:</b> [pace 250] [pause 25] [click] [pause 5]
     up up right right right right right [click] [pause 5]
     up up left left left left left right [click] [pause 10]
     up left left left left left [click] [pause 5]
     [pace 1000] down [gridpos down right] [click] [pause 3] [click]<br>
</p>
<p>
   Note that the Program EXE setting should be literally <b>[STEAM]</b>, including
   the brackets.
</p>
<p>
   Notes about those Table Folder and Extension settings:
   <i>Pinball Arcade</i> isn't like most of the other systems,
   in that it doesn't have "table files" analogous to Visual Pinball's .vpt/.vpx
   files.  Its tables are more or less built in to the program.  This means that
   PinballY's normal way of searching for playable table files won't work for
   this system.  To make up for that, PinballY has its own folder that contains
   dummy files that list all of the Farsight tables.  These files all have names
   like <b>The Addams Family (Midway 1992).pinballArcade</b>, so the <b>Table folder</b>
   and <b>Table extension</b> settings shown above will allow PinballY to find all
   of these files and thereby recognize the game names.  The files are all empty;
   all of the information is contained in their names.
</p>
<p>
   Farsight adds new tables from time to time, so your version of TPA might have
   some tables that haven't made it into the list supplied with PinballY yet.
   If that happens, you can simply create a new file for the new table by
   copying one of the old ones and renaming it to reflect the new table's name.
</p>
<p>
   The "Startup Keys" sequence is a huge mess, I know, but it seems to be the only
   way to automatically navigate to a particular game.  The key sequence is designed
   to step through Pinball Arcade's menu screens to get to the icon for the game,
   using the grid position configured for the game.  You can just copy and paste
   that whole sequence into the field.
</p>

<h3>The Pinball Arcade DX11</h3>

<p>
   <b>System class:</b> Other<br>
   <b>Program EXE:</b> [STEAMDIR]\SteamApps\common\PinballArcade\PinballArcade11.exe<br>
   <b>Parameters:</b> <br>
   <b>Process name:</b> <br>
   <b>Environment:</b> SteamAppId=238260;SteamGameId=238260<br>
   <b>Window Mode:</b> Show<br>
   <b>Table folder:</b> [PinballY]\Farsight<br>
   <b>Table extension:</b> .pinballArcade<br>
   <b>Startup Keys:</b> same as Pinball Arcade above<br>
</p>

<h3>Pinball Arcade DX11 with Free Camera Mod (FCM)</h3>

<p>
   <b>System class:</b> Other<br>
   <b>Program EXE:</b> C:\TPAFreeCamMod\TPAFreeCamMod.exe<br>
   <b>Parameters:</b> <br>
   <b>Process name:</b> PinballArcade11.exe <span style="padding-left:1em;">(see note below)</span><br>
   <b>Environment:</b> SteamAppId=238260;SteamGameId=238260<br>
   <b>Window Mode:</b> Show<br>
   <b>Table folder:</b> [PinballY]\Farsight<br>
   <b>Table extension:</b> .pinballArcade<br>
   <b>Startup Keys:</b> same as Pinball Arcade above<br>
</p>
<p>
   <b>Note:</b>  you'll have to adjust the C:\... path in the Program Exe entry
   to match the location where you've installed the program.  PinballY doesn't
   have any special knowledge of the Free Camera Mod install location (the way
   it does with Steam), so that has to be entered with the exact folder path.
</p>


<h3>Pinball FX2</h3>
<p>
   <b>System class:</b> STEAM<br>
   <b>Program EXE:</b> [STEAM]<br>
   <b>Parameters:</b> -applaunch 226980 "[TABLEFILEBASE]"<br>
   <b>Window Mode:</b> Minimize<br>
   <b>Process name:</b> Pinball FX2.exe<br>
   <b>Table folder:</b> steamapps\common\Pinball FX2\data\steam<br>
   <b>Table extension:</b> .pxp<br>
   <b>DOF Prefix:</b> FX2<br>
</p>
<p>
   The Program EXE text should be entered literally as <b>[STEAM]</b>, including
   the brackets.  Don't substitute a file path or anything else; just write it
   literally like that.
</p>

<h3>Pinball FX3</h3>
<p>
   <b>System class:</b> STEAM<br>
   <b>Program EXE:</b> [STEAM]<br>
   <b>Parameters:</b> -applaunch 442120 "-table_[TABLEFILEBASE]"<br>
   <b>Window Mode:</b> Minimize<br>
   <b>Process name:</b> Pinball FX3.exe<br>
   <b>Table folder:</b> steamapps\common\Pinball FX3\data\steam<br>
   <b>Table extension:</b> .pxp<br>
   <b>DOF Prefix:</b> FX3<br>
</p>
<p>
   The Program EXE text should be entered literally as <b>[STEAM]</b>, including
   the brackets.  Don't substitute a file path or anything else; just write it
   literally like that.
</p>
<p>
   To enable the improved "Hot Seat" physics for the newer Williams tables, add
   the option flag <b>-class</b> to the Parameters line:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   <b>Parameters:</b> -applaunch 442120 -class "-table_[TABLEFILEBASE]"<br>
</div>
<p>
   Alternatively, for multi-player hotseat modes, replace the <b>-class</b>
   option with <b>-hotseat_2</b> for 2-player, <b>-hotseat_3</b> for 3-player,
   or <b>-hotseat_4</b> for 4-player.
</p>

<h3>Zaccaria</h3>
<p>
   <b>System class:</b> STEAM<br>
   <b>Program EXE:</b> [STEAM]<br>
   <b>Parameters:</b> -applaunch 444930 -rotate left<br>
   <b>Startup Keys:</b>  [pace 1000] [click playfield] enter enter enter enter [pace 2000] enter enter [pace 1200] enter enter<br>
   <b>Run before:</b> c:\Zaccaria\LaunchZaccaria.exe [[TABLEFILE]]
</p>
<p>
   The program file <b>c:\Zaccaria\LaunchZaccaria.exe</b> is a compiled
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">AutoHotKeys</a>
   script.  In order for this to work, you'll need to install AutoHotKeys
   (a free program) and the script.  Here's the script:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   <a href="https://github.com/mjrgh/PinballY/files/4936850/LaunchZaccaria.zip">https://github.com/mjrgh/PinballY/files/4936850/LaunchZaccaria.zip</a>
</div>
<p>
   Extract the .ahk file, compile it with AutoHotKeys, and install it
   in a C:\Zaccaria folder.  You can rename the folder or put it on
   a different drive if preferred - just to be sure to change the Run
   Before setting to match the path.
</p>
<p>
   Thanks to euston-r for providing this recipe (see
   <a href="https://github.com/mjrgh/PinballY/issues/153" target="_blank">Issue #153</a>
   on github).
</p>
   


<h2>Details on the settings</h2>

<p>
   The individual settings are explained below.  For most systems, you
   should be able to leave most of the fields blank.
</p>

<h3>System name</h3>
<p>
   This is the name that PinballY displays when referring to the system
   in the user interface, such as in the summary information box shown when
   the game is selected in the "wheel" menu.   The name is really only for
   display purposes, and doesn't have any special meaning to PinballY.
</p>

<h3>Delete System</h3>
<p>
   Click this button if you want to completely remove this system from
   your PinballY configuration.
</p>
<p>
   This button has no effect on the actual installed program
   system that the setting page refers to.  It won't uninstall your
   Visual Pinball player or anything crazy like that.  It just deletes
   the PinballY settings for the system.
</p>

<h3>Enable</h3>
<p>
   Check this box if you want to include the system's games in the
   "wheel" menu list.  If this box isn't checked, the system's games
   will be ignored. 
</p>
<p>
   The main reason for this box is that it lets you retain the default
   configuration settings for all of the pre-defined systems, even those
   that you don't currently have installed, just in case you ever want
   to install them in the future.  If you do install one of these systems
   in the future, you'll be able to use it in PinballY simply by
   checking the existing entry's Enable box, rather than having to enter all
   of the system's options anew.
</p>

<h3>Media folder</h3>
<p>
   This is the name of the sub-folder for this system's "media" files:
   "wheel" icons, instruction card images, flyer pages, images and videos
   for the playfield and backglass, etc.
</p>
<p>
   This is always a sub-folder of the main PinballY media folder, which
   you can configure in the "Folders" page in the options dialog.  The
   folder name entered here shouldn't contain any path prefix or
   any "\" characters; it's just the name of the sub-folder.
</p>
<p>
   By default, each system's media folder name is simply the same as
   the system name.  Leave the folder name blank to use this default.
   If you're migrating from a PinballX installation, its media folders
   are always named the same as the corresponding systems.
</p>
<p>
   It's okay to have multiple systems sharing the same media folder.
   For example, if you have both Visual Pinball 9.2 and 9.9 installed,
   you might want to use a single "Visual Pinball" media folder for
   both systems.
</p>
<p>
   You can enter the folder name directly into the text box, or you
   can <a href="SystemOptionsBrowseSubfolder.html">browse for an existing folder</a>
   by clicking the folder icon
   (<img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="folderIcon.png">)
   next to the text box.
</p>

<h3>Database folder</h3>
<p>
   This is the name of the sub-folder for this system's "table database"
   files.  These are the XML files that list the games for the system
   and provide their bibliographic details (titles, manufacturers, etc).
</p>
<p>
   This is always a sub-folder of the main PinballY table database
   folder, which you can configure in the "Folders" page of the options
   dialog.  The folder name entered here shouldn't contain any path
   prefix or any "\" characters; it's just the name of the sub-folder.
</p>
<p>
   The default folder name is the same as the system name.  Leave
   the folder name blank to use this default.  If you're migrating
   from PinballX, its database folders are always named the same
   as the corresponding systems.
<p>
   Every system must have its own separate table database folder.
   Table database folders can't be shared.
</p>
<p>
   You can enter the folder name directly into the text box, or you
   can <a href="SystemOptionsBrowseSubfolder.html">browse for an existing folder</a>
   by clicking the folder icon
   (<img style="vertical-align: middle;" src="folderIcon.png">)
   next to the text box.
</p>

<h3>System class</h3>

<p>
   We said above that we try to be "system agnostic", avoiding special
   handling for any one system, but a few systems are so ubiquitous that
   we do have some special recognition for them.  Specifically, Visual
   Pinball 8-9, Visual Pinball 10, Future Pinball, and Steam-based games.
   This doesn't mean that PinballY only supports those systems; it just
   means that PinballY has some special handling for those systems.
</p>
<p>
   You should select the option here that matches the system you're
   setting up.  If you don't see your system in the list, it's not
   a problem!  Just select "Other".
</p>
   

<h3>Table extension</h3>

<p>
   If the system uses separate table files, enter the filename
   extension for the files:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>For Visual Pinball 9 or earlier, enter <tt>.vpt</tt>
   <li>For Visual Pinball X, enter <tt>.vpx</tt>
   <li>For Future Pinball, enter <tt>.fpt</tt>
</ul>

<p>
   Leave this blank if the system doesn't use table files (e.g.,
   any of the Steam-based systems).
</p>

<h3>DOF prefix</h3>

<p>
   This is a prefix code used for entries in the DOF configuration.  This
   is just a convention used in the DOF Config Tool, to distinguish
   the DOF settings for the same game written in different player
   systems.  For example, the Config Tool database includes listings
   for numerous re-creations of real games that were written
   for both Visual Pinball and Future Pinball.  Entering the
   correct prefix helps PinballY identify the right DOF settings to
   use depending on which game is selected in the "wheel".
</p>
<ul>
   <li>For Future Pinball, enter <tt>FP</tt>
   <li>For Pinball FX2, enter <tt>FX2</tt>
   <li>For Pinball FX3, enter <tt>FX3</tt>
</ul>

<p>
   Leave it blank in other cases.  The DOF Config Tool treats
   Visual Pinball games as the "default" system, so the different
   versions of VP never use a prefix.
</p>


<h3>Program EXE</h3>
<p>
   This is the name of the application file (.exe) that PinballY
   will launch when you play a table using this system.  There are
   several choices here:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Leave it blank:</b>  PinballY will automatically launch
   the program that's associated in the Windows registry with the
   filename extension in the "Table Extension" box.  For example,
   if the extension is set to <b>.vpt</b>, the program associated
   with the .vpt extension would be launched.  This is the same
   program that Windows launches when you double-click on a file
   of that type in the Windows desktop.

   <p>
      Use this option whenever possible, since it's 
      the most future-proof choice.  If you use this approach,
      you won't have to worry about updating the PinballY settings
      the next time you update the program to a new version, or
      reinstall it in a different folder, since PinballY should
      be able to pick up the new location automatically from
      the registry.
   </p>

   <li><b>Specify the .exe name only:</b>  If you enter the .exe
   name without a path prefix (e.g., <tt>VPinball921.exe</tt> rather than
   <tt>c:\VisualPinball\VPinball921.exe</tt>), PinballY will look for the
   file in the folder containing the program that's associated with
   the file extension, but it will replace the registered program
   with the named program instead.
   <p>
      This option is especially good for Visual Pinball, since
      it's common to have multiple VP 8/9 versions installed on
      one pin cab at the same time.  All VP 8/9 versions
      use the .vpt file extension, but Windows only allows one
      program to be associated with a given extension, so they
      can't all use the fully automatic lookup of the "leave it
      blank" option.  This ".exe name only" option is the next best
      thing in this case.  As long as all of the different VP
      executables are installed in the same folder, this option
      lets you specify the specific VPinballXXX.exe program to
      run for each version, but still lets PinballY find the
      folder location based on the .vpt registry settings.  That
      at least makes the settings future-proof against
      reinstalling VP in a different folder.
   </p>

   <li><b>Specify a full path:</b>  If you don't have a Windows
   registry association for the file extension, you'll have to
   enter the full path for the program, as in <tt>c:\VisualPinball\VPinball921.exe</tt>.
   PinballY will simply launch this exact program file without
   consulting the registry or any other hidden information.
   Clicking on the folder button next to the box lets you browse for the
   program .exe file.

   <li><b>[STEAM]:</b>  For Steam-based programs like Farsight's
   Pinball Arcade or Pinball FX2/FX3, you can enter the special
   name <b>[STEAM]</b> (exactly like that, including the brackets).
   This tells PinballY to find the Steam executable using Steam's
   installation records in the Windows registry.  As with the
   "leave it blank" option, this future-proofs the settings against
   updates to Steam or changes to its location.

</ul>

<a name="parameters"></a>
<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>
   Enter the command-line parameters for the command here.  There's
   no general rule to how the parameters look; the parameters are
   entirely peculiar to the individual programs.  See the "recipes"
   section above for the parameter formats for the common systems.
</p>
<p>
   There are some special "substitution variables" that you can
   use in the parameters.  When the program is launched, these will
   be replaced with value specific to the game you're launching.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>[TABLEPATH]</b>: the full path name to the table file for the
   game you're running.  For example, for a Visual Pinball game, this is
   the full path of the VP "Tables" folder, so it'll be something like
   <tt>c:\VisualPinball\Tables</tt>.

   <li><b>[TABLEFILE]</b>: the filename of the table file for the
   game you're running, <b>without</b> any path prefix, and <b>with</b>
   the system's default extension added, if that's necessary to form
   the name of an existing file.   For example, for a Visual Pinball 9
   version of <i>Funhouse</i>, this might be something like
   <tt>funhouse_v2.vpt</tt>.  

   <li><b>[TABLEFILEBASE]</b>:  the "base" filename for the table,
   with any extension removed.  This differs from [TABLEFILE] in that
   any extension is stripped from the end, leaving just the base name
   of the file.  This also differs from [TABLEFILEORIG] in that
   the extension is <b>always</b> removed from [TABLEFILEBASE],
   whereas [TABLEFILEORIG] is never altered from the database version
   of the filename.  In other words, if the filename <i>as it appears
   in the database</i> contains an extension, [TABLEFILEORIG] will
   contain the same extension, whereas [TABLEFILEBASE] won't.

   <li><b>[TABLEFILEORIG]</b>: the "original" filename of the table,
   exactly as it appears in the table database file.  This differs from
   [TABLEFILE] in that [TABLEFILE] might have the system's default
   file extension added, whereas [TABLEFILEORIG] has the exact original
   filename from the database.

   <li><b>[PINBALLY]</b>: the full path to your PinballY install
   folder (e.g., <tt>c:\PinballY</tt>).

   <li><b>[LB]</b>: a literal left square bracket, <b>[</b>.

   <li><b>[RB]</b>: a literal right square bracket, <b>]</b>.
</ul>

<h3>Environment</h3>
<p>
   The "environment" is a Windows internal feature that lets programs
   create a list of NAME=VALUE strings in memory.  The main use of these
   is to pass information from a parent program to a child program that
   it launches.  It serves much the same purpose as the command line
   parameters, but it's a different mechanism.  Some programs depend
   upon having certain information passed this way rather than using
   the command line parameters, which is why PinballY lets you specify
   these variables.
</p>
<p>
   Windows has a "global" list of environment variables that you can
   set via the system control panel, and these global variables are
   passed to each program that you launch from the Windows desktop.
   But programs can also add their own "local" variables that are
   only visible to child processes they create.  That's the type
   we're creating here.  The variables you list here will be added
   to the environment that PinballY receives from Windows, and
   passed to the game program when you launch it, but they won't
   affect the global system environment variables at all.
</p>
<p>
   To add environment variables, list them in the edit box as
   NAME=VALUE pairs.  You can list as many of these as you want;
   separate them with semicolons (;).  If you want to use a semicolon
   within a value, double it (";;") to distinguish it from a
   variable separator.
</p>
<p>
   For example, to directly launch Pinball Arcade DX11, you have
   to pass a couple of environment variables to the program:
</p>
<pre>    SteamAppId=238260;SteamGameId=238260
</pre>

<h3>Window Mode</h3>
<p>
   This lets you specify the initial visibility of the launched
   game program's first window when the program starts up:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Show</b> shows the window normally
   <li><b>Minimize</b> minimizes the window to the taskbar
   <li><b>Hide</b> hides the window
</ul>

<p>
   "Minimize" mode is useful for Visual Pinball and Future Pinball,
   because these programs always open their editor windows first, and
   you don't really want to see those when launching straight into
   playing a game.  It makes the game startup a little smoother
   if you don't see that editor window flash into view briefly
   while the game is being loaded.
</p>
<p>
   "Minimize" is also good for games launched through Steam,
   since you don't need to see the Steam launcher window; you
   want the first visible window to be the game itself.
</p>
<p>
   "Show" is best for any game that you launch directly (not
   through Steam) that goes straight to its game window.  Use
   this when directly launching the Pinball Arcade DX11
   executable, for example.
</p>


<a name="ProcessNameBox"></a>
<h3>Process name</h3>

<p>
   This is a weird special case needed mostly for Steam games (that is,
   games that are installed and launched via Valve's "Steam" system).
   Steam games use a two-step launch procedure where you run the
   STEAM.EXE application first, and that in turn runs the separate game
   program .exe (application) file.  In Windows terminology, each running
   .exe is a "process".  So when you run a Steam-based game like Farsight's
   Pinball Arcade or Pinball FX2, you're really launching two processes:
   STEAM.EXE, and the actual game's .exe file.  This complicates things a
   bit for PinballY, because it needs to monitor each launched game process
   to determine when the game terminates, so that PinballY can take over
   when the game exits.  And the real complication is that STEAM.EXE itself
   terminates as soon as it launches the game .exe, so PinballY can't
   use STEAM.EXE as a proxy for whether the game is running; it has
   to monitor the separate process where the game's .exe is running.
</p>
<p>
   That's where the "Process name" setting comes in.  This lets you
   identify the name of the game process that Steam launches.
   This is simply the name of the game's .exe file, without any
   path prefix.  For example, for The Pinball Arcade, this is
   <tt>PinballArcade.exe</tt>.  
</p>


<a name="startupKeys"></a>
<h3>Startup keys</h3>
<p>
   This defines a sequence of keystrokes and mouse clicks to be sent to the
   launched program after it starts up.  There are three main uses for this:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>First, to set focus on the right window after launch if needed.
   Future Pinball in particular needs a mouse click on its playfield
   window before it'll accept keyboard input.  You can do this with
   a simple <b>[click playfield]</b> sequence, which sends a mouse
   click to the middle of the playfield window.

   <li>Second, to click through any initial dialogs the
   game system displays at startup.  You can use a sequence like
   <b>enter enter</b> to send a couple of Enter key presses to the
   program to dismiss dialogs.

   <li>Third, to navigate any menus the game presents at startup.  This
   is needed for Farsight's Pinball Arcade, since it presents its own
   game selection menu.
</ul>

<p>
   See the "recipes" section above for the recommended settings
   for the various systems.  If you need to create a custom key
   sequence, here are the key names and special commands you
   can use:
</p>

      list above, as in <b>[gridpos comma period]</b> or, more likely, <b>[gridpos down right]</b></td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Terminate by</h3>

<p>
   This specifies how PinballY terminates a running game launched
   with this system when you press the Exit Game button.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Close Window:</b>  This is the default.  This simply closes
  all of the program's open windows, as though you manually closed
  them with the mouse.  This is considered the best way to
  terminate a program, since it's the way most programs expect to be
  terminated under normal conditions, and because it allows the program
  to perform an orderly shutdown, releasing system resources before it
  exits.  This option should be used in most cases.  Consider other
  options only if this one doesn't work reliably for a
  particular game system.

  <li><b>Kill Process:</b>  This asks Windows to terminate the process
  directly.  This is a more forceful way to stop a program, because it
  doesn't require any cooperation from the program itself.  It's the same
  thing that Task Manager does when you ask it to kill a process.  However,
  if you've ever done this with Task Manager, you're familiar with that
  warning message it displays about how this kind of termination can harm
  system stability.  Killing a process doesn't give the target program a
  chance to do the cleanup work it would normally do on exit.
  This can, in some cases, leave system resources (like files or
  devices) locked or in other dubious states.  This option is
  sometimes necessary, though, because some programs won't cooperate
  properly with the more polite Close Window approach.  Use this as
  a last resort when the Close Window option doesn't work reliably.
</ul>


<h3>Table folder</h3>

<p>
   Enter the folder where this system's tables are located.
</p>
<p>
   If you're new to virtual pinball, it might seem puzzling and limiting that
   you have to specify a single folder here.  But that's the long-standing
   convention that's more or less forced by the design of Visual Pinball
   and Future Pinball, so it's assumed by most of the rest of the pin cab
   ecosystem.  It's not great for people who download a large number of
   tables and want to impose some kind of order on things, but you'll just
   make things unnecessary hard on yourself if you try to work around it.
</p>
<p>
   There are three formats for the entry here:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Leave it blank:</b>  PinballY assumes that tables are in the
   same folder as the program EXE if you leave this blank.

   <li><b>Enter a full folder path:</b>  If you enter a full, absolute
   folder path with drive letter (e.g., <tt>c:\VisualPinball\Tables</tt>),
   PinballY will simply use the exact path you enter.

   <li><b>Enter a "relative" folder name:</b>  If you enter a relative
   path with no drive letter prefix (e.g., <tt>Tables</tt>), PinballY
   will treat it as a sub-folder of the main folder containing the
   program EXE.
   <p>
      It's best to use this format when possible, because you won't
      have to update this setting if you should reinstall the player
      system in a different main program folder in the future.
      PinballY will automatically use whatever main program folder
      is current on each run.
   </p>
</ul>

<p>
   Within the folder path, you can use some special substitution
   variables.  PinballY will replace these with actual file system
   paths when the program starts up.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>[PinballY]</b> is replaced with the full path to the
   PinballY program folder.  This is in absolute path format, so
   it can only be used at the start of the folder path.  For example,
   <b>[PinballY]\Farsight</b> points to the Farsight folder within
   the PinballY install folder.

   <li><b>[PinballX]</b> is replaced with the full path to the
   PinballX install folder, if present on your machine.

   <li><b>[SteamDir]</b> is replaced with the full path to the
   Steam program install folder, if present on your machine.

   <li><b>[lb]</b> is replaced with a literal left square bracket, <b>[</b>.

   <li><b>[rb]</b> is replaced with a literal right square bracket, <b>]</b>.
</ul>

<h3>NVRAM folder</h3>

<p>
   This is the folder where NVRAM (non-volatile RAM) files for the
   system's games are stored.  The NVRAM files are where the high
   score listings are stored, so this path needs to be set correctly
   for PinballY to be able to display high scores in the game list.
</p>
<p>
   This setting is only meaningful for Future Pinball and Visual Pinball,
   since PinballY can only read high scores from those types of systems.
</p>
<p>
   There are three ways to enter this setting:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Leave it blank:</b>  PinballY will use the standard NVRAM path
   for the system.  In the case of Visual Pinball, this is the NVRAM folder
   from your VPinMAME setup, as recorded in the registry.  For
   Future Pinball, this is the fpRAM sub-folder of the main Future
   Pinball program folder.  This is the best option in most cases,
   because you won't have to update it if you ever reinstall the
   player system in a new location.

   <li><b>Enter a full path:</b>  If you enter a full, absolute path
   with drive letter (e.g., <tt>c:\VisualPinball\VPinMAME\nvram</tt>),
   PinballY will use the folder exactly as specified.

   <li><b>Enter a relative path:</b>  If you enter only a sub-folder
   name with no path prefix (e.g., <tt>fpRAM</tt>), PinballY will
   look in that sub-folder of the system's main program folder.
</ul>


<h3>Run Before</h3>
<p>
   The Run Before (1) and (2) boxes let you enter commands to run just
   before launching a game, each time a game using this system is launched.
   You can use these to do any preparation needed before this system
   starts up, such as modifying the monitor layout, resetting hardware
   devices, or starting background tasks that run concurrently with
   the game.
</p>
<p>
   The commands in the (1) and (2) slots are executed in sequence,
   under slightly different visual display conditions.  Here's the
   exact sequence of events:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The user selects "Play Game" from the menu to launch the game
   <li>PinballY updates the playfield window to show a completely blank, black display
   <li>The command in slot (1) is executed
   <li>PinballY displays a "Launching game" message in the playfield window
   <li>The command in slot (2) is executed
   <li>The game is launched
</ul>

<p>
   The important distinction between the (1) and (2) slots is that
   the command in the (1) slot is executed with a completely blank,
   black playfield window, whereas the command in the (2) slot is
   executed after the "Launching game" message has been displayed.
   This might be important to you if the command you're launching
   does something that affects the system-wide visual layout of the
   monitors, such as changing the rotation or scaling factors.
   You might prefer to take that sort of action in phase (1),
   since the blank playfield window will help make the transition
   to the new visual layout smoother by avoiding any obvious 
   change in the on-screen graphics.  A completely black screen
   looks the same at any rotation or scale, so the moment when
   the layout changes won't be visually apparent to the user.
</p>
<p>
   You can use each slot to launch just about any Windows program.
   Use the standard Windows command line syntax, as though typing a
   command into the Windows+R "Run" box.  If you want to run a series
   of commands, the easiest approach is to create a .BAT file containing
   the commands, and run that with a command line like this:
</p>
<pre>    CMD /c c:\users\bob\BatchFile.bat
</pre>
<p>
   The .BAT format is a standard way in Windows to write a simple command
   script to carry out a series of commands.  If you're not familiar with the
   .BAT format, you can find lots of information about it on the Web by
   searching for "Windows batch script".
</p>
<p>
   You can put a special "flags" string at the very start of the
   command line to control how the command is processed.  The flags are
   specified in square brackets, at the very start of the command.
   The flag keywords are:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>NOWAIT:</b> PinballY will execute the command and leave it running.
   If you don't specify this, PinballY will wait for the program to exit before
   proceeding to the next step.  The benefit of NOWAIT is that it can make
   the game start up more quickly, since the game launch doesn't have to wait
   for this pre-launch task to finish.  Be careful with this, though, because
   it will leave the program running until it exits on its own.  If you launch
   a program with NOWAIT, and that program doesn't exit on its own in a
   reasonable amount of time, you could end up with many copies of the program
   running, since a new copy will be launched every time you start a new game.  
   You also shouldn't use NOWAIT if the program does something that needs
   to be finished before the game starts, because the whole point of NOWAIT
   is that it doesn't force the game to wait for the task to finish.

   <li><b>TERMINATE:</b>  PinballY will explicitly terminate the running process
   as soon as the game exits.  Use this in combination with WAIT (that is,
   specify [NOWAIT TERMINATE]) for a program that you want to leave running to
   carry out some background task throughout the game session, but that you want to shut down as soon as the game finishes.
   This is often a better option than the plain NOWAIT, since it ensures that
   each copy of the program launched is terminated when the game ends.

   <li><b>HIDE:</b>  Launches the command with its window hidden.  This is
   useful for CMD scripts, so that you don't see a DOS box window pop
   up briefly while the script is running.

   <li><b>MINIMIZE:</b>  Launches the command with its window minimized.
   This is useful for a background task that you want to leave running
   (via NOWAIT), so that its window doesn't appear in the UI but is
   still accessible through the Windows desktop if necessary.

   <li><b>ROTATE(<i>window</i>,<i>angle</i>):</b> Rotate the given UI
   window by the given angle just before executing the command. 
   The <i>window</i> can be PLAYFIELD, BACKGLASS, DMD, TOPPER, or
   INSTRUCTIONS.  The <i>angle</i> is always clockwise, and can be
   90, 180, or 270.  Note that there must be <b>no
   spaces</b> in the whole construct.  For example, to rotate the playfield
   window by 90 degrees clockwise, write [ROTATE(PLAYFIELD,90)]. 
   If you need to do a counter-clockwise rotation, just remember
   that 90 degrees counter-clockwise is the same as 270 degrees
   clockwise, and vice versa, and 180 degrees is the same in
   either direction.
   <p>
      The system automatically undoes the cumulative rotation
      for all windows after the game exits, just before returning to
      the main UI after the game exits.  This means that it's not
      strictly necessary to use a ROTATE flag in the Run After to
      compensate for one in the Run Before.  But you're certainly
      free to write one anyway, so that you can control the timing
      of the change.  For example, if you place [ROTATE(PLAYFIELD,90)]
      in the Run Before (1) command, you'd usually place
      [ROTATE(PLAYFIELD,270)] in the Run After(2) to cancel out
      the change and return to the original rotation.  
   </p>

   <li><b>ADMIN:</b>  Launches the command in Administrator mode.
   This is available only when running PinballY via the
   <b>PinballY Admin Mode.exe</b> version of the program.
   <p>
      You should only use the [ADMIN] option as a last resort.
      Avoid Admin mode whenever possible, in part because it exposes
      your system to more security risks, but more so because it
      creates a lot of complications for other software.  Windows
      restricts normal program-to-program interactions when an
      Admin mode program is running, which can cause weird problems
      in the user interface and can make some program features
      stop working.
   </p>
</ul>
<p>
   You can specify multiple flags for the same command by writing a
   series of the flag keywords within the single pair of square brackets,
   separating the keywords by spaces.  For example:
</p>
<pre>    [HIDE ROTATE(PLAYFIELD,90) ROTATE(BACKGLASS,180)] cmd /c ...
</pre>
<p>
   There are also some "substitution variables" you can use anywhere within
   the command string:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>[TABLEPATH]</b>: the full path name to the table file for the
   game you're running.  For example, for a Visual Pinball game, this is
   the full path of the VP "Tables" folder, so it'll be something like
   <tt>c:\VisualPinball\Tables</tt>.

   <li><b>[TABLEFILE]</b>: the filename of the table file for the
   game you're running, <b>without</b> any path prefix, and <b>with</b>
   the system's default extension added, if that's necessary to form
   the name of an existing file.   For example, for a Visual Pinball 9
   version of <i>Funhouse</i>, this might be something like
   <tt>funhouse_v2.vpt</tt>.  

   <li><b>[TABLEFILEBASE]</b>:  the "base" filename for the table,
   with any extension removed.  This differs from [TABLEFILE] in that
   any extension is stripped from the end, leaving just the base name
   of the file.  This also differs from [TABLEFILEORIG] in that
   the extension is <b>always</b> removed from [TABLEFILEBASE],
   whereas [TABLEFILEORIG] is never altered from the database version
   of the filename.  In other words, if the filename <i>as it appears
   in the database</i> contains an extension, [TABLEFILEORIG] will
   contain the same extension, whereas [TABLEFILEBASE] won't.

   <li><b>[TABLEFILEORIG]</b>: the "original" filename of the table,
   exactly as it appears in the table database file.  This differs from
   [TABLEFILE] in that [TABLEFILE] might have the system's default
   file extension added, whereas [TABLEFILEORIG] has the exact original
   filename from the database.

   <li><b>[PINBALLY]</b>: the full path to your PinballY install
   folder (e.g., <tt>c:\PinballY</tt>).

   <li><b>[LB]</b>: a literal left square bracket, <b>[</b>.

   <li><b>[RB]</b>: a literal right square bracket, <b>]</b>.
</ul>


<h3>Run After</h3>

<p>
   The Run After (1) and (2) boxes let you enter commands to run just
   after the game exits.  These work very much like the Run Before commands,
   but run after the game instead of before.
</p>
<p>
   As with the Run Before commands, there are two Run After slots, which
   run their respective commands under slightly different display conditions.
   Here's the sequence for the Run After commands:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The user presses the Exit Game key (or otherwise exits the game)
   <li>PinballY attempts to bring its window to the foreground (if Windows allows it)
   <li>PinballY displays the "Exiting game" message in the playfield window
   <li>PinballY waits for the game program to terminate
   <li>The command in slot (1) is executed
   <li>PinballY updates the playfield window to show a blank, black screen
   <li>The command in slot (2) is executed
   <li>PinballY restores the normal interactive playfield display
</ul>
<p>
   This sequence is essentially the reverse of the Run Before sequence
   with respect to the display conditions.  The command in the (2) slot is
   executed with a blank screen showing in the playfield window, so it's the
   right place to run any command that will modify the system-wide
   monitor layout.
</p>
<p>
   You can use the same flags and substitution variables as
   with Run Before.  As with the Run Before command, you should be careful
   when using [NOWAIT] that you can count on the program to exit on its
   own in a reasonable amount of time.
</p>
<p>
   [NOWAIT TERMINATE] is accepted for the Run After commands, but it's not
   very useful, since the termination condition in this case is the return
   to the normal PinballY interactive interface.  Since that will happen
   almost immediately after these commands are launched, they'll only have
   a few moments to run before PinballY terminates them.  It's difficult
   to think of a situation where the [NOWAIT TERMINATE] combination would
   be useful for a Run After command.
</p>

<h3>Run Before/After pairings</h3>

<p>
   The overall sequence of the launch is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Run Before (1)
   <ul>
      <li>Run Before (2)
      <ul>
         <li>Game
      </ul>
      <li>Run After (1)
      </ul>
   <li>Run After (2)
</ul>

<p>
   It's best to think of these as "nested" steps, as suggested by
   the indentation in the list above.  The Run Before (1) and
   Run After (2) are the "outer" steps:  they're done first and last.
   The Run Before (2) and Run After (1) steps are the "inner" steps,
   done just before and just after the game runs.  And the game itself
   is the "innermost" step, nested within the others.
</p>
<p>
   The point of this nested view of the steps is that it should help
   you decide where to put any necessary cleanup tasks when you're
   arranging your command sequence.  If Run Before (1)
   makes any system-wide changes, they should be undone in Run After (2),
   since that's the matching After step for Run Before (1) in the
   nested view.  Similarly, any system-wide
   changes made in Run Before (2) does should be undone in
   Run After (1).   Cleanup is necessary for any
   system-wide changes you make, such as changes to the monitor
   layout, or changes to your mouse or keyboard settings.  You'll
   need to reverse such changes before the main PinballY window
   returns, so that settings are back to normal after the game
   finishes.  
</p>
<p>
   PinballY tries to help ensure that any cleanup steps are
   properly executed by always running the paired commands
   suggested in the nesting diagram above.  In particular,
   the following pairings are guaranteed:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>If Run Before (1) is executed, Run After (2) will also be executed
   <li>If Run Before (2) is executed, Run After (1) will also be executed
</ul>
<p>
   The steps will always be carried out in those matched pairs, even in
   case of error, and even if the user manually interrupts the game launch
   by pressing the Exit Game button during one of the early steps.  This
   should help ensure that your commands will always have a chance to
   undo any system-wide setting changes made during the launch process
   so that everything is returned to normal after each game session.

<h3>Keep these PinballY windows open</h3>

<p>
   These checkboxes let you tell PinballY to continue displaying graphics
   and videos in the selected windows while games based on this system are
   running.
</p>
<p>
   The controls here apply to all games using this system.  These settings
   override the "global" settings in the
   <a href="GameLaunchOptions.html">Game Launch</a> page.  You can in
   turn override the system settings individually for each game,
   using the <a href="EditGameDetails.html">Game Details</a> dialog.
   These three locations for the settings form a hierarchy:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The global settings in the Game Launch options act as defaults for all systems and all games
   <li>Each system's settings act as defaults for all games for that system, and
   override any conflicting global Game Launch settings
   <li>Each game's individual settings override any conflicting global
   or system-specific settings
</ul>
<p>
   You'll notice that these checkboxes are a little unusual, in that
   they have <i>three</i> possible states:
</p>
<style type="text/css">
ul.ckboxNotes img {
    vertical-align: middle;
    margin-right: 1ex;
}
img.ckbox {
    vertical-align: middle;
}
</style>
<ul class="ckboxNotes">
   <li><img src="CkBoxChecked.png"> Show this window's graphics while running
   <li><img src="CkBoxBarred.png"> Blank this window while running
   <li><img src="CkBoxEmpty.png"> Use the default global setting
</ul>
<p>
   The first two settings, "show" and "blank", override the global
   setting for the window from the Game Launch options.
   The third option, "use defaults", means that the global setting is used.
   In all cases, any conflicting settings made in the Game Details dialog for a
   particular game override the settings here, but only for that individual game.
</p>
<p>
   Why would you want to continue showing PinballY window graphics during
   game play?  In most cases, you wouldn't, which is why the initial
   default settings (globally, per-system, and per-game) are all set
   to blank out PinballY's graphics during play.  This reduces PinballY's
   memory and CPU usage while the game is running, giving more system
   resources to the game so that it can run faster and more smoothly.
   However, if you have a pin cab setup with multiple monitors, you
   might find that some games can't take advantage of all of your
   display area.  For example, some commercial PC pinball games
   don't display anything at all in the DMD or backglass area, or
   can only display boring still graphics.  In those cases, you
   might prefer to let PinballY continue to display its graphics
   in those areas during play.
</p>
<p>
   The checkboxes here apply to all games running under the selected
   player system, so you can use these controls in cases where all
   games for a system have the same handling for the various windows.
   For example, if a system never displays anything in the DMD
   area, you can use the checkbox here to tell PinballY to continue
   displaying DMD graphics for all games using that system.  In
   cases where a system is inconsistent - some of the system's games
   make use of the DMD, say, while others don't - you might prefer
   to make the selection on a game-by-game basis using the
   <a href="EditGameDetails.html">Game Details</a> dialog.
</p>
<p>
   <b>"DMD" vs. "Real DMD":</b>  The DMD checkbox refers to PinballY's
   on-screen window where it displays DMD-style graphics.  The Real DMD
   checkbox refers to your physical DMD device (such as a PinDMD or
   Pin2DMD unit), if you have one.  The Real DMD isn't a window, but the
   same principle applies: if you check this box, PinballY will continue
   to show its image or video media on your real DMD device while the
   game is running.  This will prevent the launched game from displaying
   anything on the DMD, since the real DMD devices only allow access from
   one program at a time.  (In some cases, a game that tries to access
   the device might detect the conflict and show an error, or exit
   abruptly, or even crash, so it's best to use this option only with
   games that don't try to access the DMD device themselves.)
