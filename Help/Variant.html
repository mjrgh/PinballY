<h1>Variant objects</h1>

<p>
   Variant is a Javascript system class representing a native COM
   VARIANT value.
</p>
<p>
   The COM VARIANT type is essentially the native-code (C/C++) representation
   of the Visual Basic "ANY" type, which can hold any VB value.
   VARIANT is so named because the type of data stored in a particular
   VARIANT varies at run-time.  Any type value can be stored there, and the type
   of value in a particular VARIANT can be changed dynamically
   each time a new value is stored.  
</p>
<p>
   A VARIANT variable can hold any of a large number of native types,
   as listed in the <a href="#typeTable">type code table</a> below.
   A VARIANT is tagged with the specific type of value it's currently
   holding, so a caller can always determine how to properly
   interpret the value.  Only one type of value is stored in a given
   VARIANT at any one time.  Setting it to a new value replaces the
   old value and can change it to a new type.
</p>
<p>
   VARIANTs are widely used in Windows
   COM interfaces, especially in scripting-oriented interfaces designed to
   interoperate with Visual Basic and ActiveX control hosts.
   VARIANT is implemented in C/C++ code as a struct type, so in principle,
   you could define the struct yourself in terms of the general-purpose
   native type mechanisms provided by the DLL Importer.  But you
   wouldn't want to, because the raw VARIANT C struct is complex, tedious
   to work with, and demands careful handling to manage its memory properly.
   So instead, PinballY provides this built-in type that makes it much
   easier to work with VARIANTs when you need them for COM calls or
   other purposes.  The Javascript Variant object provides properties
   for convenient conversion between Javascript and native types,
   and it handles the required memory management details automatically.
</p>
<p>
   The Variant type is really only intended for use with COM and other
   native-code APIs that are written in terms of VARIANTs.  You probably
   won't want to use Variants in purely Javascript code, as Variant does
   essentially the same thing as Javascript's own built-in type system,
   but less efficiently and less conveniently, since it's an external
   object type.
</p>

<h2>Creation</h2>

<p>
   You can create a Variant value with "new", just like any other type.
</p>
<div class="code">
let v = new Variant();
</div>

<h2>Value access</h2>

<p>
   A Variant is a Javascript object, so the underlying value that it
   stores has to be accessed through properties.  The main property for
   accessing the internal value is the <b>.value</b> property.
</p>
<div class="code">
message("v = " + v.value);
v.value = "String Value";
v.value = 100;
</div>

<p>
   When you read the .value property, it translates the native type stored
   in the internal VARIANT struct to the closest Javascript equivalent.  Integer
   and floating point types are returned as Javascript number values, for
   example, and native string types are returned as Javascript strings.
   Similarly, when you assign a new Javascript value to the .value property,
   the value is translated to a native type and stored in the internal
   VARIANT, with the VARIANT's type tag automatically set to the new
   native type.
</p>

<p>
   Variant objects also have a <b>.vt</b> property that lets you get or set the
   current type indicator.  ("vt" stands for "variant type"; it's the name of
   the element from the C struct, so we use the same name for the sake of
   people used to the C version.)  This lets you determine the native type
   being used for the current value.  You can also assign a value to .vt,
   which has the effect of deleting any old value in the native VARIANT
   struct and replacing it with a "default" value of the new type, usually
   zero for numeric types and null or empty for other types.  Some COM
   interfaces that return values through a VARIANT expect the caller to
   set the type tag of the VARIANT to the desired return type before making
   the call, which you can do by setting the .vt property.
</p>

<h2>Arithmetic</h2>

<p>
   A Variant is a Javascript object, so you can't use the normal
   Javascript arithmetic operators directly on a Variant, even if
   the Variant happens to contain a numeric value.
   Instead, you'll have to retrieve the contained value as a Javascript
   number using the .value method, perform the desired arithmetic
   operations on the Javascript number, and store the result
   back in the Variant by assigning it to the .value property or
   to one of the type-specific assignment properties (which we'll
   come to shortly).
</p>

<h2>Default type assignments</h2>

<p>
   When you assign a value to a Variant object through the .value method,
   the native VARIANT type is automatically inferred from the Javascript type
   assigned.  The type mappings are shown in the table below.
</p>
<table class="dataTable">
   <tr><th>Javascript Type Assigned to .value</th><th>Resulting Variant Type</th><th>Example</th></tr>
   <tr><td>Number</td><td>VT_R8 (double-precision floating point)</td><td>v.value = 100</td></tr>
   <tr><td>String</td><td>VT_BSTR (Basic string)</td><td>v.value = "string"</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Boolean</td><td>VT_BOOL (Variant Boolean)</td><td>v.value = true</td></tr>
   <tr><td>Date</td><td>VT_DATE (Variant Date)</td><td>v.value = Date.now()</td></tr>
   <tr><td>undefined</td><td>VT_EMPTY (Empty)</td><td>v.value = undefined</td></tr>
   <tr><td>null</td><td>VT_NULL (Null)</td><td>v.value = null</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Setting a specific type</h2>

<p>
   You'll notice from the full table of <a href="#typeTable">type codes</a>
   below that VARIANT has many more sub-types than Javascript variables do.
   For example, VARIANT includes all of the native integer and floating point
   types common on Intel hardware, plus some special numeric types used in Visual
   Basic and the Windows OLE subsystem (Currency, Decimal), whereas Javascript
   only has the one numeric type "Number".
</p>

<p>
   Some COM interfaces that take VARIANT parameters require specific
   subtypes to be stored in the VARIANT arguments, and will fail with an
   error if the wrong subtype is used.  The defaults listed above
   therefore won't always work for all callees.  While the .value property
   only lets you set the types listed above, the Variant object has other
   type-specific properties that allow setting an exact subtype.  For the
   full list, see the <a href="#typeTable">type code</a> table below.  The
   "Set Via" column shows the property used to set each specific type.
   For example:
</p>
<div class="code">
v.bVal = 100;        // set the type to VT_UI1 (Byte) and set the byte value to 100
v.fltVal = 123.456;  // set the type to VT_R4 (Float) and set the float value to 123.456
</div>

<p>
   Note that each type-specific property sets the value <i>and</i> the internal
   type tag in the native VARIANT.  It's not necessary to set the type code
   separately when assigning through these properties.  If you read the .vt
   property after making one of these assignments, it will yield the VT_xxx
   value for the type of the last assigned value.
</p>

<p>
   You can also read values from the "Set Via" properties (e.g., <tt>let x = v.bVal</tt>).
   However, these properties will only work when the Variant contains the corresponding
   type; they'll throw an error otherwise.
</p>
<div class="code">
v.iVal = 2000;   // set the type to VT_I2 (Short)
let x = x.iVal;  // okay, v contains an iVal; reads back the 2000 we just stored
let y = v.bVal;  // THROWS AN ERROR: v does not contain a VT_UI1 (Byte) value
</div>

<h2>Passing VARIANT* arguments to COM calls</h2>

<p>
   Nearly all COM interfaces that work with VARIANT values require <i>pointer to VARIANT</i>
   parameters, written in C function prototypes as <b>VARIANT*</b>.
</p>
<div class="code">
dllImport.define(`
interface IPropertyBag "55272A00-42CB-11CE-8135-00AA004BB851" : IUnknown
{
    HRESULT Read(LPCOLESTR pszPropName, VARIANT *pVar, IErrorLog *pErrorLog);
    HRESULT Write(LPCOLESTR pszPropName, VARIANT *pVar);
};`);
</div>

<p>
   When calling a function that takes a VARIANT* parameter, you can simply
   pass a Variant value.  The DLL importer will automatically pass the
   address of the native VARIANT struct contained in the Javascript Variant
   object.
</p>
<div class="code">
let v = new Variant();
propBag.Read("Name", v, null);
</div>

<a name="typeTable"></a>
<h2>Type codes</h2>

<p>
   The native VARIANT's "vt" struct element is an integer value that
   indicates the current type of value stored in the struct.  The
   type names from the Windows SDK headers are predefined as Javascript
   const values in the PinballY system files, so you can use the same
   names you'd see in C++ examples.
</p>
<p>
   The table below lists only the type codes that are valid with Variants.
   The Windows headers define a number of other type codes that can be
   used in other contexts, so you'll find additional codes in the system
   files, but only the codes listed below can be used with Variants.
</p>
<p>
   The Set Via column shows how to explicitly store a value for each type.
   The type-specific property names match the member names in the native
   C VARIANT struct, to make it easier to translate any C/C++ COM coding
   examples you might refer to.

<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   <b><i>variant</i>.value:</b>  Gets or sets the value stored in
   the native VARIANT.  Reading .value translates the stored native
   value to the closest Javascript equivalent and returns the value.
   See the table of types above for the .value results for the
   native types.
</p>
<p>
   Setting .value to a new value translates the Javascript value
   to the closest native equivalent.  Numbers are stored as
   variable "double" values, which are identical to Javascript's
   internal number format.  Strings are stored as BSTR (Basic
   string) values.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>variant</i>.vt:</b> Gets or sets the internal "vt" field of the
   native VARIANT struct, which indicates the current type of the value
   stored in the VARIANT struct.  Reading .vt returns the current type
   code, which is one of the VT_xxx values defined above.
</p>
<p>
   Setting .vt to a new value clears any value currently in the native
   VARIANT, and updates the internal "vt" field in the native struct
   to the new type code.  The old value is automatically cleared when
   you set the "vt" property to avoid any chance that the old value
   would be misinterpreted, which could corrupt memory and crash the
   program in some cases.  So be aware that setting "vt" will have the
   side effect of changing the "value" result as well.
</p>

<h2>Type-specific getter/setter properties</h2>

<p>
   In addition to the properties listed above, Variant has a property
   for each of the native VARIANT subtypes, such as .iVal for the
   "short int" type and .dblVal for the "double precision float" value.
   These are listed in the <a href="#typeTable">type code table</a>
   above, in the Set Via column.
</p>
<p>
   When you assign a value
   to one of the type-specific properties, it sets the internal
   type tag field ("vt") in the VARIANT object to the corresponding
   VT_xxx code, converts the assigned value from the Javascript
   format to the corresponding native type format, and stores
   the converted native type in the VARIANT's internal data field.
</p>
<p>
   The per-type properties are mostly for <i>setting</i> the
   VARIANT value, but you can also read from these properties,
   <i>as long as the stored type matches the property</i>.  An error
   is thrown if you try to read a type-specific property and the
   underlying VARIANT object contains a different type.  When you
   read the type-specific property, the result is a Javascript
   representation of the native value.  (The native value in
   the VARIANT isn't affected.  It remains stored in the native
   representation.  The returned Javascript value is just a
   copy.)  It's generally easier to read from the .value property
   instead, since that automatically converts from whichever
   native type the VARIANT stores, using the automatic conversions
   listed in the <a href="#typeTable">type code table</a> under
   the ".value Reads As" column.
</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>
   Some VARIANT subtypes are unsupported or only partially
   supported:
</p>

<ul>
   <li>VARIANT Record (structure) types aren't supported

   <li>VARIANT Array types aren't supported

   <li>VARIANT BYREF pointers to most non-primitive types (that is,
   types other than simple integer and float types) aren't supported

   <li>The CURRENCY and DECIMAL types are supported, but they're
   represented in Javascript as simple Javascript numbers.  This
   could result in loss of precision and/or rounding errors
   when converting to Javascript and back to Variant.
</ul>
