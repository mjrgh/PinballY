<h1>dmdWindow Object</h1>

<p>
   <b>dmdWindow</b> is a pre-defined PinballY object representing the
   DMD window in the user interface.  The DMD window (for "Dot Matrix Display") is
   the window that simulates the plasma score display on 1990s+ pinball machines.
   It can also emulate the alphanumeric display on 1980s games.
</p>
<p>
   Note that <b>dmdWindow</b> refers to the <b>video simulation</b> of the
   dot matrix display, not to a physical DMD device (if you have one).  This
   is just one more video window that displays images and videos from
   your Media folder.  In this case, it's assumed that the images and videos
   in the Media folder will look like dot matrix displays (or alphanumeric
   displays, for older games), but that's not a "rule" - you can display
   whatever type of graphics you want here.  For older games that predate
   digital displays, for example, you could use this as an extension
   of the backglass artwork.
</p>
<p>
   The DMD window works like most of the <a href="SecondaryWindow.html">Secondary Windows</a>,
   in that it displays image and video files in your Media folder tree designated
   for the DMD window.  It has the additional special feature that it synthesizes
   graphics to display the live high scores as recorded by the game player
   system, when available, using a display style appropriate for the game's
   era.  The synthesized high score graphics are automatically alternated
   with the background images or videos from the Media folders, to approximate
   the way that modern pinball machines display a series of animations and
   high score screens while in attract mode.

<h2>Class inheritance structure</h2>
<p>
   This object is an instance of the <a href="SecondaryWindow.html">Secondary Window</a>
   class, so it has all of the behavior defined in that class, as well
   as in the <a href="WindowObjects.html">base window class</a>.
</p>
<div>
   <a href="WindowObjects.html">Basic Window Object</a> &rarr;
   <div class="indented">
      <a href="SecondaryWindow.html">Secondary Window</a> &rarr;
      <div class="indented">
         dmdWindow
      </div>
   </div>
</div>


<h2>Event target</h2>

<p>
   The DMD window object is an event target, so you can use the standard
   event methods (on(), off(), addEventListener(), etc) to add and remove
   event listeners.  See <a href="EventTarget.html">EventTarget</a>.  This
   window receives the following event types:
</p>

<div class="eventTargetTOC" data-eventtarget="SecondaryWindow BaseWindow"></div>

<h2>Methods and properties</h2>
<p>
   This object is a <a href="SecondaryWindow.html">Secondary Window</a>, so
   it inherits the methods and properties defined for that class as well as
   the <a href="WindowObjects.html#common">common window base class methods and properties</a>.
   It doesn't currently have any additional properties or methods beyond the common set.
