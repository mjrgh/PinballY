<h1>Custom Media Window</h1>

<p>
   Starting with version 1.1, PinballY lets you create your own
   additional "Media Windows" from Javascript.  A Media Window is
   essentially the same as any of PinballY's built-in secondary windows:
   the backglass window, DMD window, topper window, and
   instruction card window.  The only differences are that you
   create these windows with Javascript code, and you can specify
   what kind of media they use for their background images and
   videos.
</p>
<p>
   There are basically two steps to creating a custom window:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The first step, which you can skip in some cases, is to create a "Media
   Type" descriptor for the window.  PinballY comes with a bunch
   of pre-defined media types that apply to the built-in windows:
   Table Image, Table Video, Backglass Image, Backglass Video, etc.
   Using Javascript, you can define additional media types of
   your own, so that you can add your own media files that go
   beyond the basic set that PinballY knows about by itself.
   For example, if you wanted to add a picture of the original
   pinball machine for each game, you could define a Pinball Machine
   Image media type.
   <p>
      New media types are created via
      <a href="GameList.html#createMediaType">gameList.createMediaType</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
      You can skip this step if you want the window to use one
      of the built-in media types (backglass images, for example;
      see <a href="MediaTypes.html">Media Types</a> for a full list),
      or if you don't want the window to automatically display
      any background media at all.  You might omit automatic
      background media if you were going to program completely
      custom graphics for the window using  <a href="DrawingLayer.html">Drawing Layers</a>, for example.
   </p>

   <li>The second step is to create the window itself.  This is
   done by calling
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#createMediaWindow">mainWindow.createMediaWindow()</a>.
   This lets you specify the type of media the window will display
   automatically.  You can specify a background image type,
   a background video type, or both.
</ul>
<p>
   Once the window is created, it acts like the backglass window
   and the other built-in windows.  You can use the mouse to
   size it and position it where you want it, and PinballY will
   automatically save and restore that position across sessions.
   Whenever you navigate to a new game in the wheel UI, PinballY
   will automatically load the game's background image or video,
   according to the media types you specified when creating
   the window.
</p>
<p>
   Custom windows have full support for <a href="DrawingLayer.html">Drawing Layers</a>,
   so you can go beyond this simplest use of just displaying loading per-game
   images and videos, by creating custom graphics through Javascript.
   We'll see how to do that later in this section.
</p>
<p>
   The rest of this section goes through a few ideas for how
   you can use custom windows, showing how to implement each one.
   We'll start with the simplest things to implement and build
   on that as we go.
</p>


<h2>Wheel icon window</h2>
<p>
   Some pin cab builders get especially creative with embedding
   monitors in unique places in their cabs.  A great example is
   <a target="_blank" href="https://www.vpforums.org/index.php?showtopic=44487">Vanlon's <i>CANNONBALL!</i> pin cab</a>,
   which features a 5" <b>circular</b> (!) display panel embedded in a
   custom 3D-printed cannon topper.  It's one of the best examples
   of a themed topper I've seen.  If you have a unusual extra monitor
   like this, you'll obviously want to take advantage of it at
   every opportunity, so this would be a great place to use a
   custom window.
</p>
<p>
   For a monitor with such a small display area, the wheel icon
   might make a good choice for the graphics to display.
</p>
<p>
   This is an especially easy example to implement, because
   PinballY already knows about wheel images.  All we have to
   do is create a custom window that uses wheel images as
   its background image type.
</p>
<p>
   But how do we say that we want
   to use "wheel images" in concrete terms?  By referencing
   the "wheel image" media type.  A media type is a data record
   inside PinballY that has all of the information about something
   like the wheel icons: what kind of file formats they use
   (PNG, etc), which directory they're stored in, and so on.
   PinballY has a bunch of media types built in - one for each
   of the media items that you can use in the system windows,
   such as playfield images, backglass videos, and so on.
   For a list of the built-in types, see <a href="MediaTypes.html">Media Types</a>.
</p>
<p>
   Each media type has an ID that we can use to refer to it in Javascript.
   (You'll find that in the table of built-in types linked above.)
   For wheel images, the ID is "wheel image".  So to create our
   custom window that always shows the current wheel image, we
   just have to use mainWindow.createWindow() and specify
   "wheel image" as the background image type.
</p>
<div class="code">
// Create the window, using the "wheel image" media type for the
// background image
let wheelIconWin = mainWindow.createMediaWindow({
    title: "Wheel Icon",
    configVarPrefix: "customWindow.WheelIcon",
    backgroundImageMediaType: "wheel image",
});

// Use the "zoom" scaling mode for this window, to keep the icon's
// original aspect ratio (rather than stretching it to fit the
// whole window)
wheelIconWin.backgroundScalingMode = "zoom";
</div>
<p>
   Apart from the background image, the only other details we had
   to specify for the new window were its title and its "configuration
   variable prefix".
</p>
<p>
   The title is what's displayed in the title bar,
   and it also appears in some system menus.  It's just there to
   identify the window to you in those contexts, so you can pick
   whatever name you like for it.  There's no need for the title
   to be unique or use any special format, but you probably
   shouldn't make it completely empty, since it might be confusing
   in menus.
</p>
<p>
   The config variable prefix, on the other hand, does have some
   special requirements for its format.  It should be mostly alphanumeric,
   but you can also safely use periods, hyphens, and underscores.
   <b>Don't</b> use any spaces, and don't use any other special
   characters or punctuation, because this string will go into
   the configuration file (Settings.txt) several times.  This string
   is used as the prefix for all of the settings variables that
   pertain to this window - that's where PinballY stores the
   window's location, visibility, and layout information between
   sessions.  I personally like using something like "custom" or
   "customWindow" as a prefix to the prefix, just to make it
   obvious when looking at the settings file that it's a
   custom window created through Javascript.  That's not a
   requirement, just a convention that I think might be helpful
   down the road, especially if you ever look at the settings
   file to troubleshoot some other problem.  After the prefix,
   add some description of the window, in this case
   "customWindow.WheelIcon".
   Again, if you ever have to look at the settings file later
   on, it'll be helpful if you choose a name for this that
   makes some kind of sense to you and that will jog your
   memory in the future.
</p>
<p>
   The final detail in this example is that we've set the
   <a href="CustomWindow.html#backgroundScalingMode">background scaling mode</a>
   for the window to "zoom".  The default scaling mode is "stretch",
   which stretches out the image to exactly fill both the
   width and height of the window, even if that requires
   distorting the image geometrically.  That's the default
   because it's usually what you want for things like
   backglass images, where it's more important (to me, at least)
   to fill the available space than to maintain the geometry
   of the original image.  But for wheel icons, we're not
   going to fill the whole space anyway, so it seems
   better to maintain the original aspect ratio.
   The "zoom" option sizes the image so that it's as large
   as possible without exceeding either the width or height
   of the window and without any geometrical distortion.
</p>

<p>
   We could embellish this example just a little by adding a custom
   background color.  Wheel icon images are usually transparent
   PNGs - the area around the icon is usually left transparent
   so that a background image (usually the playfield image or
   video) can show through.  The wheel icon <i>is</i> the background
   image in this case, so there's nothing behind it other than
   the default black background that the system draws.
   A different background color might look a little more
   interesting.  We can accomplish that using a
   <a href="DrawingLayer.html">drawing layer</a>.  The trick is
   to create a drawing layer with a negative Z index, so that the
   drawing layer goes behind the window's built-in main layer where
   the background media (the wheel icon, in this case) is drawn.
</p>
<div class="code">
let wheelIconBackground = wheelIconWin.createDrawingLayer(-1);
wheelIconBackground.clear(0xffff00ff);
</div>
<p>
   0xffff00ff is opaque bright purple. (The first "ff" is the opacity,
   and the next six numbers, ff 00 ff, give the red, green, and blue
   components.  FF is programmer speak, or more technically
   hexadecimal, for 255, which is the maximum brightness for
   each color component.  So we have maximum opacity, maximum
   red, maximum blue, and zero green.  That makes bright purple
   in the RGB color scheme.)
</p>
<p>
   In playing around with this example, I thought it looked a
   little boring to use a single, fixed background color, so I
   came up with a further embellishment that rotates through
   different colors as you switch games.  The idea is to use
   <i>two</i> extra drawing layers, with an interval timer
   that cross-fades between the two layers using alpha
   transparency.  We initiate the background color change at
   the same time that the window switches to a new icon by
   triggering on the <a href="MediaSyncEvent.html"><b>mediasyncload</b></a>
   event.  That event fires when the window is about to load
   new background media, and start its own cross-fade to
   the new image, so it's exactly the right time to start.
   our own cross-fade effect.
</p>

<div class="code">
// Rotating Color Background.  Create two background layers,
// using negative Z-Indices to place them BEHIND the main
// media layer where the wheel icon appears.  We'll accomplish
// our color transitions by fading the foreground window in
// and out, switching directions on each fade.
// crossfade.
let overlayfg = wheelIconWin.createDrawingLayer(-1);
let overlaybg = wheelIconWin.createDrawingLayer(-2);

// Background colors.  We rotate through this list of colors,
// switching to the next color each time we load new media.
//
// The transitions work best when one RGB component changes and
// the rest stay the same.  When two components both change, you
// get a sort of wink-out/wink-in effect that looks like a double
// fade.
let colors = [0xff00ff, 0x0000ff, 0x00ffff, 0x00ff00, 0xffff00, 0xff0000];
let colorIndex = 1;

// Set up the initial conditions: background showing first color,
// foreground fully transparent at the second color, and alpha
// change (dAlpha) set to positive.  The number of steps determines
// the timing of the overall transition; this is in terms of 1/60th
// of a second redraws.
overlaybg.clear(0xff000000 | colors[0]);
let transitionFgColor = colors[1];
overlayfg.clear(transitionFgColor);
let transitionRunning;
let transitionAlpha = 0;
let transitionSteps = 15;
let transitionDAlpha = 0xff / transitionSteps;

// Start the cross-fade effect each time we're about to load new
// background media into the window.
wheelIconWin.on("mediasyncload", ev => {
    // End the current transition, skipping straight to the end if we're
    // only part of the way there.  Sets up the next transition.
    function endTransition() {
        if (transitionRunning) {
            // stop the interval timer
            clearInterval(transitionRunning);
            transitionRunning = false;

            // skip straight to the final foreground alpha
            transitionAlpha = (transitionDAlpha > 0 ? 0xff : 0);
            overlayfg.clear((transitionAlpha << 24) | transitionFgColor);

            // get the next transition color
            colorIndex = (colorIndex + 1) % colors.length;
            let nextColor = colors[colorIndex];

            // set up the next transition in the opposite direction
            transitionDAlpha = -transitionDAlpha;
            if (transitionDAlpha > 0) {
                // foreground fading in - the foreground gets the next color,
                // and the background stays the same color (since it's the one
                // current showing)
                transitionFgColor = nextColor;
            }
            else {
                // foreground fading out - the background gets the next color,
                // and the foreground stays the same color
                overlaybg.clear(0xff000000 | nextColor);
            }                
        }
    }

    // if there's a transition running, end it immediately
    endTransition();

    // start the new transition
    transitionRunning = setInterval(() => {
        transitionAlpha += transitionDAlpha;
        if (transitionAlpha > 0xff || transitionAlpha < 0) {
            endTransition();
            return;
        }
        overlayfg.clear((Math.floor(transitionAlpha) << 24) | transitionFgColor);
    }, 16);
});
</div>
   
<p>
   I can think of one more improvement: rather than cycling
   through a series of generic colors, pick a color that's appropriate
   for each game.  One way to do this would be to read the DOF settings
   file and extract one of the color fields appropriate to the current
   game; the Undercab RGB color might be a good choice.  The DOF settings
   file format doesn't make it easy to extract that kind of information,
   but it's possible with some work.  Another approach might be to
   keep a custom color setting for each game in some other ad hoc
   file that you maintain via Notepad.  I'll leave these ideas as
   exercises; if anyone is motivated to implement one of them and
   share it, I'd be happy to add it here as a further example.
</p>


<h2>Flyer window</h2>
<p>
   Most of the HyperPin media packs that you
   can find on the virtual pinball sites (such as
   <a target="_blank" href="https://vpforums.org">vpforums</a> or
   <a target="_blank" href="https://vpuniverse.com">vpuniverse</a>)
   include scanned copies of the machines' original advertising flyers.
   PinballY has a command for viewing the current game's
   flyer as a popup in the main window, but if you have some extra
   display space, you could set up a separate window dedicated to
   displaying the flyer.
</p>
<p>
   As with the Wheel Image window above, it's simple to set this
   up in a custom window since PinballY already has a built-in
   media type for Flyer Images.  In this case, the identifier
   for the media type is "flyer image".
</p>
<div class="code">
// Create the window, using the "wheel image" media type for the
// background image
let flyerWin = mainWindow.createMediaWindow({
    title: "Flyer",
    configVarPrefix: "customWindow.Flyer",
    backgroundImageMediaType: "flyer image",
});

// Flyers use a wide range of shapes, from regular "portrait
// mode" letter-sized pages to "landscape mode" pages to
// two-page or multi-page fold-out spreads.  So I think it's
// best to preserve the original aspect ratio.
flyerWin.backgroundScalingMode = "zoom";
</div>

<p>
   That much is just like setting up the Wheel Icon window in
   the last example.  But Flyers have a little bit of a difference
   form wheel icons, as a media type: Flyers can come in sets
   rather than single images.  Many of the original advertising
   flyers were printed on double-sided pages, or came as a fold-out,
   two-page spread, and some were more like little brochures.
   It wouldn't be very usable if the HyperPin media packs
   stitched all of those pages into a single JPEG image,
   most of the media packs come with a separate JPEG image
   for each Flyer page.  Instruction cards in the HyperPin
   media packs are also often provided in sets, since most
   arcade pinball machines came with several sets of
   instruction cards with variants of the rules that the
   operator could choose from.
</p>
<p>
   So how do we handle the multiple Flyer pages?  If we look
   to the way PinballY handles flyer displays itself, we see
   that PinballY lets the user scroll through the collection
   using the flipper buttons.  That works for PinballY's
   standard flyer display because that happens in a popup box.
   Popup boxes are modal, which means we can use the flipper keys in
   that context for something other than their usual meaning
   (usual in PinballY, anyway) of switching games.  That
   obviously won't work for a separate window that's always
   displayed.  For that, we're going to need another approach.
</p>
<p>
   Before we get to how to handle the user interface aspect
   of this, I should mention how we handle it at the Javascript
   level.  That much is easy: the custom window has a special
   property for it, <a href="CustomWindow.html#pagedImageIndex">pagedImageIndex</a>.
   Reading this property tells you the current image being displayed,
   as a number starting at 0 for the first image in the current
   game's collection.  Setting the property to a new value changes
   to the selected image.  One easy way to use the property is
   to treat it as a way to scroll forwards and backwards through
   the image collection, by incrementing or decrementing it.
   The system automatically "wraps" the value when you go past
   the beginning or end of the list, so there's no need to do
   any bounds checking; just increment and decrement away.
</p>
<p>
   Now, back to the UI.  One way to handle it would be to assign
   some keyboard keys to scroll through the flyers.  If you have
   a couple of spare buttons available, this is just a matter
   of setting up a <a href="KeyEvent.html#keydown"><b>keydown</b></a>
   event handler that adjusts the pagedImageIndex property:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("keydown", ev => {
    if (ev.code == "KeyH")
        flyerWin.pagedImageIndex += 1;
    else if (ev.code == "KeyG")
        flyerWin.pagedImageIndex -= 1;
});
</div>
<p>
   Here we've arbitrarily chosen the "G" and "H" keyboard keys,
   but you can easily change those to any available keys on your cab.
</p>
<p>
   You could also do this with a menu command instead of directly
   through the keyboard, although that seems so inconvenient to me
   that I'm not going to bother working out the code for it.  Many
   of the other Worked Examples sections have menu examples that
   you should be able to easily adapt.
</p>
<p>
   Another approach that avoids the keyboard is to flip the pages
   automatically on a timer, say every five seconds.  This would work
   like the automatic High Score display rotation in the DMD window.  This
   is pretty easy:
</p>
<div class="code">
setInterval(() => { flyerWin.pagedImageIndex += 1; }, 5000);
</div>
<p>
   Remember that <a href="SystemFunctions.html#setInterval">setInterval()</a>
   takes its time period in milliseconds, so we tell it to run this
   function every 5000 ms, which is the same as 5 seconds.
</p>
<p>
   We could improve this timed approach slightly by taking note of
   when a new flyer is loaded, and resetting the interval timer when
   that happens.  Without that, the running timer will just keep
   running every five seconds, so it might jump in and change to
   the second page only a fraction of a second after switching to a new game,
   if that just happens to be its next scheduled run time.  We
   could make this a little smoother by clearing the old interval
   timer and setting up a new one each time a game switch occurs.
</p>
<div class="code">
let flyerTimer;
flyerWin.on("mediasyncload", ev => {
    clearInterval(flyerTimer);
    flyerTimer = setInterval(() => { flyerWin.pagedImageIndex += 1; }, 5000);
});
</div>
<p>
   We use the <a href="MediaSyncEvent.html"><b>mediasyncload</b></a> event
   to trigger the timer reset, because this event tells us when a new game's
   flyer is about to be loaded, usually because we just switched to
   a new game in the wheel UI.
</p>

<p>
   It's worth noting that this multiple media problem applies to PinballY's own
   Instruction Cards window, but that window ignores this issue completely.
   In the case of the instructions, I figured that the virtual cab
   owner is going to do exactly what the arcade operator does with
   a real pinball machine's instruction cards: install the one that
   you want to use.  In the case of the arcade operator, you'd take
   the card out of the pack and pop it into the machine's apron.
   For the virtual cab owner running PinballY, you just
   rename the version of the card that has your preferred
   instruction set so that it's the un-numbered card in
   the folder.  That approach doesn't work with a multi-page
   flyer, though.
</p>


<h2>Original pinball machine picture window</h2>
<p>
   So far our examples have all worked with "standard" media
   types that come with the HyperPin media packs and that
   PinballY already knows about.  Now let's look at how you
   can extend the idea to entirely new media categories
   that aren't part of the standard HyperPin collection.
</p>
<p>
   One idea that comes to my mind is that it might be nice
   to see a picture of the original pinball machine - the
   whole machine as it would have looked in an arcade.
   A lot of machines have rather nice cabinet artwork
   that we never see during virtual play.
</p>
<p>
   What's different about this example is that we can't
   rely on one of the pre-defined media types when we create
   our window.  PinballY simply doesn't include a built-in
   type for whole-machine pictures.  But PinballY does let
   us define our own new types to supplement the built-in
   types it knows about.  We do this through a method
   on the <a href="GameList.html">gameList</a> object
   called <a href="GameList.html#createMediaType">createMediaType()</a>.
</p>
<p>
   Defining a new media type is a matter of filling in all of
   the information that PinballY keeps internally for its own
   built-in media types:  where to look for a game's
   files of that type, what file formats they use, and how to
   refer to them in the UI.  You can read about all the details
   in <a href="MediaTypes.html">MediaTypes</a>, so we'll
   just show the code needed for our "pinball machine picture"
   example.
</p>
<div class="javascript code">
gameList.createMediaType({
    name: "Cabinet Image",
    id: "cab image",   // this is how we refer to the type later
    folder: "Cabinet Images",
    format: "Image",
    extensions: ".jpg .jpeg .png",
    configId: "CabinetImage",
    perSystem: false,
    isIndexed: true
});
</div>

<p>
   Most of this is pretty straightforward (at least, it should be
   after reading through the <a href="MediaTypes.html">MediaTypes</a>
   section), but there are a couple of things worth pointing out:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>We set <b>perSystem</b> to false, which makes
   our cabinet images "generic".  That means that the media folder
   will only contain one set of images for, say <i>Medieval Madness</i>,
   which will be used for <i>any</i> virtual version of the game
   based on any pinball simulator system, from Visual Pinball to
   Future Pinball to FX3.  This seems to me like the right call
   for cabinet images, since this is something that refers back
   to the original machine being simulated, rather than to
   something unique to each simulator.  The built-in types for
   Instruction cards and Flyers work the same way, for the same
   reason.

   <li><b>isIndexed</b> is set to true, which means that we can
   have multiple cabinet images for each table.  The files are
   distinguished in the media with numeric suffixes:
   "Medieval Madness (Williams 2004) 1.jpg",
   "Medieval Madness (Williams 2004) 2.jpg", and so on.  There
   can also be a plain "Medieval Madness (Williams 2004).jpg"
   alongside those, without any number - if it's there, it
   counts as an implied "number zero" in the list.
   <p>
      The built-in type for Instruction Cards is also an indexed
      type, because many of the original machines came with a
      selection of cards with variations on the rules for the
      operator to choose from.  Many of the HyperPin media packs
      reproduce that full selection, and some also come with
      translated versions.  Flyers use a slightly different
      convention for multiple images, known as "paged" media
      (which sorts the multiple files into subfolders, rather
      than using a numeric suffix).  I think Cab Images are a
      good fit for the indexed type, since you might find
      several good ones for a given game, but there's no
      particular structure to them; they're just different
      takes on the same thing.  The "paged" folders that Flyers
      use are more appropriate when the images constitute
      parts of a whole.
   </p>
</ul>

<p>
   Once we've defined our new media type, the window creation is
   exactly like before.  The only difference is that we reference
   the new media type, using the <b>id</b> property we assigned when
   creating the type, in the part of the window descriptor where
   we specify the background image type.
</p>
<div class="code">
// Create the window, using our new custom Cabinet Image media type
// as the background image type
let cabPicWin = mainWindow.createMediaWindow({
    title: "Cabinet",
    configVarPrefix: "customWindow.CabImage",
    backgroundImageMediaType: "cab image"  // the "id" of the type
});

// maintain the original image proportions
cabPicWin.backgroundScalingMode = "zoom";

// since this is an indexed type, meaning there can be multiple
// cab images for each game, set up an interval timer to flip
// through them at a leisurely pace
let cabPicTimer;
cabPicWin.on("mediasyncload", ev => {
    clearInterval(cabPicTimer);
    cabPicTimer = setInterval(() => { cabPicWin.pagedImageIndex += 1; }, 5000);
});
</div>

<p>
   Note that we created a timer to flip through the images,
   in case a given table has multiple cab images available.
   This works exactly like the one in the earlier Flyers example:
   we just increment the window's <b>pagedImageIndex</b> every
   few seconds to switch to the next available photo.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Installing media:</b> Now, one little detail remains,
   which is that you probably don't any cabinet images
   installed to test this out with.  The HyperPin packs
   don't include anything like this.  So you'll have to
   make a separate trip to the Web to find these.
</p>
<p>
   One reliable place to look is <a target="_blank" href="https://ipdb.org">IPDB</a>
   (the Internet Pinball Database). They have photos
   for most of the commercial pinball tables ever built,
   usually including at least one full-cabinet photo.
</p>
<p>
   The easiest way to install a cabinet photo from the Web
   is to drag it from the browser and drop it onto your
   custom window.  One of the nice things about the Media
   Type system is that it tells PinballY not only where to
   look for existing photos, but how to handle installation
   when you drop a new photo onto a window.  The system will
   automatically install a photo dropped on your custom
   Cabinet Images window as a Cabinet Image media item.
   You can also add photos directly into the media folder
   via the Windows desktop; see <a href="DirectoryInfo.html">Files &amp; Folders</a>
   for help figuring out where the images are actually stored.

<h2>Apron "Score Card" window</h2>
<p>
   Many pin cab builders install a pseudo-"apron" at the bottom of their
   cab, below the main TV, as a filler to make room for the plunger and so on.
   We call it an apron because it fills roughly the same space as the
   actual apron on a real pinball machine.
</p>
<p>
   On a real machine, the apron traditionally holds a pair of index
   cards, one at either side, one showing the rules of the game and
   the other showing how many quarters to insert.
   On my cab, I mimic this look with a card on the left offering
   brief instructions on how to select and launch games, and a
   card on the right announcing Free Play mode.  Just to be clear,
   the cards on my apron are physical paper cards.  But some
   cab builders get a little fancier by placing a small 6" or 7"
   monitor in place of one of the index cards, to make the space
   more interactive and more visually interesting.
   That's where the idea for PinballY's built-in Instruction Card
   window came from:  it's designed especially for cabs so equipped,
   so that you can easily display a live instruction card in
   your apron monitor as you scroll through games in PinballY.
</p>
<p>
   But what if you take this idea to its logical conclusion by
   building in a <i>second</i> apron monitor, so that both index
   card positions have live displays?  The only native PinballY window
   that's really intended for an apron monitor is the Instruction
   Card window, so there's nothing ready-made to display in
   that second monitor.
</p>
<p>
   This was actually the original use case
   that got me thinking about adding custom windows.  A forum member on
   vpforums asked if there was a way to add a second score card, to
   fit his custom cab setup with two small monitors in the apron area.
   That was the first time I've heard of anyone installing two apron
   monitors, so I hadn't considered the idea of a second dedicated
   PinballY window for the apron area.  It obviously would be a nice
   addition for cabs with two apron monitors, but this seemed like
   such a rarity that I hesitated to add a dedicated window that
   only a few people would be able to use.  That
   got me thinking that what we really need is a way to create
   whatever additional special windows you can think up to fit your cab's
   particular features, so that there's a way to address <i>all</i> of
   those unique ideas, but without overloading PinballY with a glut
   of oddball windows that would just get in everyone else's way.
</p>
<p>
   Now that we have the Custom Window feature, it's clearly
   the way to address this second-apron-monitor case, which brings
   us to the present example.
   So what should we display on a second apron monitor?  Looking
   to the real machines for ideas, we see that the apron traditionally
   has an instruction card on the left, and a pricing card on the right:
   something along the lines of "1 Play = 75&cent;/3 balls per game",
   plus the obligatory legal disclaimer, "For Amusement Only".
   We already have the Instructions Card covered, so that leaves
   the pricing card as the obvious choice.  But that probably
   isn't very interesting on a virtual pin cab, since it would
   say more or less the same thing for every game - "Free Play -
   Press Start".  That's not a very dynamic use for a monitor
   that can display unique graphics for each game.
</p>
<p>
   A more interesting idea might be a High Scores display.  This
   doesn't mimic anything you'd see on the apron on a modern
   real machine, but it's useful, and it's not
   completely out of place.  In the really old days
   of electromechanical machines, some arcades commemorated record-setting games
   with a hand-printed note placed on the apron - a precursor
   of the automatic high score displays on modern electronic games.
   It was also common until the mid-1980s for the pricing
   card to include a list of Replay Score levels. That's not quite the
   same thing as high scores, but it's at least similar.  Replay scores
   disappeared from the pricing cards in the 1990s, because someone
   at Williams came up with the bright idea of abolishing fixed
   replay levels in favor of scores that increase automatically
   when players reach them too often, to avoid giving away too
   many free games.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY already displays live high scores on the DMD using
   DMD-style graphics appropriate to the game's era, so we
   <i>could</i> just replicate that on the apron monitor.  But
   that would be a little boring.  I think it would be nicer
   to create a separate high scores window that looks like
   an apron card, with the simple black-on-white text style
   that the stock instruction cards use.  That'll make the
   Score Card on the one apron monitor harmonize visually
   with the Instruction Card window on the other monitor.
</p>
<p>
   Javascript has access to the high score information via the
   <a href="HighScoresEvent.html">highscoresready</a> event.
   That fires shortly after a new game is selected and provides
   an array of strings with the scores.  We can use that to
   build a custom image using a <a href="DrawingLayer.html">Drawing Layer</a>
   in the custom window.
</p>
<p>
   Since we're going to generate our own graphics, we don't need
   any automatic background media in this window.  We'll just fill
   the window with our custom text display.  This makes the custom
   window setup especially simple:
</p>
<p>
<div class="code javascript">
// Create the Score Card window.  This is an especially simple
// one, since it doesn't need to display any automatic media:
// all of the graphics will be custom drawn in Javascript.
let scoreCardWin = mainWindow.createMediaWindow({
    title: "Score Card",
    configVarPrefix: "custom.ScoreCard"
});
</div>

<p>
   To draw the instruction card, we're going to use the new
   <a href="HtmlLayout.html">HtmlLayout</a> object, which lets
   us display styled text using HTML markup.  We <i>could</i>
   assemble all of the text using the Custom Drawing
   text primitives, but that gets tedious for anything
   with mixed styling.  (Indeed, a first draft of this
   chapter took that approach, and writing that up convinced
   me that a higher-level text widget was worth adding.)
</p>
<p>
   HtmlLayout is pretty easy to use.  We just have to provide
   it with a block of text using HTML markup to specify the
   styling and layout, and we get back an object that we
   can use to draw the specified text layout in a window.
   We can also measure the size of the HTML text layout
   before displaying it, so that
   we know how big to make the drawing surface.  That's
   important for this case, because the high score text
   varies in length from game to game.  Older games
   usually have just a single high score, whereas the
   latest games have credit rolls that go on for pages
   and pages. (Take a look at the high score readout for
   <i>Medieval Madness</i> to see a particularly
   lengthy credits roll.)
</p>

<div class="code javascript">
// Create a drawing layer for our generated score card image
let scoreCardLayer = scoreCardWin.createDrawingLayer(1);

// When it's time to update the Score Card Window media,
// generate a new image based on the current game's high
// scores
scoreCardWin.on("mediasyncload", ev => {
    // Draw a score card, given the game title, a headline,
    // and the score text.  We'll invoke this when a newly
    // selected game's high scores are retrieved.

<p>
   I'll suggest one simple embellishment.  The code above draws
   plain black text on a white background.  That's exactly the
   same style as the stock instruction cards and pricing cards
   on most real pinball machines, so it'll harmonize perfectly
   with your Instructions Card monitor for most games.  If you
   prefer something more colorful, though, you could easily add
   <b>color</b> directives to the DIV styles, to change the
   text color to whatever you like.  You can just as easily 
   select more decorative fonts; I just went with Arial because
   it pretty well matches the plain sans-serif look of the
   stock pricing cards.  CSS also lets you set backgrounds
   and borders, so there are lots of possibilities you can
   experiment with to get a look you like.
</p>
<p>
   For even more visual interest, you could add custom background
   media for each card.  It would be a lot of work to add your own
   custom Score Card background per game, but here's an easy approach
   that works pretty well: use each game's still backglass image.
   You probably already have one of these in your media tree
   for each game, either from screen captures or from HyperPin
   media packs.  Here's how you could
   add an overlay effect that keeps the black-on-white
   look of the main text, but overlays it on top of a washed-out
   image of the backglass:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>In the custom window definition, add <tt>backgroundImageMediaType: "bg image"</tt>.
   The window will now automatically load the current game's backglass image into the background.

   <li>In the drawing code, change the color code in the call
   to <b>fillRect</b> to a semi-transparent alpha, perhaps <tt>0xE8FFFFFF</tt>.
   That'll make the card image <i>slightly</i> transparent, which
   lets the backglass image show through just enough to be visible, without
   obscuring the text too much.

   <li>You can tweak the "alpha" opacity part (the E8 in the <tt>bgColor</tt> above) to
   adjust how strongly the backglass image shows through.  Use higher numbers to make
   it look more washed out, and use lower numbers to make the colors look more
   saturated.  If you want a very saturated look, you might find that it looks
   better to switch to white text on a black background, which you can do by
   changing the <tt>txtColor</tt> and <tt>bgColor</tt> variables in the drawing code.

   <li>Another color mix that I think looks nice is to invert the
   color scheme, to white text (or other bright colors) against a dark
   background.  Change all of the text colors in the HTML
   layout to white (or similarly bright colors, like yellow and cyan),
   and change the background overlay to something like <tt>0xE8000000</tt>.
   That'll let a dimmed-out version of the backglass image show through,
   rather than a washed-out version, which contrasts nicely with bright-colored
   text.
</ul>
