<h1>Media Capture Options - FFMPEG</h1>

<p>
   This settings page groups the Media Capture options related to
   FFMPEG, the video encoding program that PinballY uses for
   screen captures.  There's a separate options page,
   <a href="CaptureOptions.html">Capture Options</a>, for the
   more generic settings related to the capture process generally.
</p>

<h2>Option details</h2>

<p>
   <b>Limit captured videos to HD resolution:</b>  Check this box
   to limit the resolution of captured videos to HD (1920x1080 pixels).
   By default, videos created using the media capture function have
   the same pixel size as the screen area being captured, but you
   can use this option to set an upper limit of HD resolution.
   This won't affect videos captured from smaller screen areas;
   it only sets an upper bound for the resolution.
</p>
<p>
   In most cases, it's best to capture at the full original
   resolution, since that gives you the most faithful reproduction
   of the original graphics.  However, videos captured from 4K
   monitors and other large formats might be too big to play back
   smoothly on older or slower systems, or might not even play back
   at all if memory is limited.  If you have a large monitor, and your
   system can't smoothly play videos captured at full size,
   you can use this option to limit the videos to HD resolution.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Use two-pass video encoding:</b>  Use this option if your
   captured videos look too choppy.  Normally, PinballY tries to
   capture and compress video frames at the same time, in
   a single pass.  This requires a fairly fast machine, though; on
   slower machines, the video encoder might drop frames (omit
   them from the resulting video) when it can't keep up with the
   live video rate.  Dropped frames are visible as momentary
   freezes when you play back the video, which can make the
   video look choppy or jerky.  If this happens on your machine,
   you can try two-pass encoding instead.  Two-pass encoding
   initially captures the video frames without any compression,
   which can usually be done without any dropped frames even on
   slower machines.  It then goes back and re-encodes the video
   to a compressed format after the full capture has finished.
   This takes longer overall because of the separate second pass,
   but should eliminate (or at least greatly reduce) dropped
   frames in the resulting video.
</p>
<p>
   Optimization tip:
   If you've tuned your system to give higher priority to pinball
   software via a tool like <a target="_blank" href="http://mjrnet.org/pinscape/PinAffinity.html">PinAffinity</a>,
   you should add <b>ffmpeg.exe</b> to the list of programs that
   receive priority CPU access.  Ffmpeg is the program that
   PinballY uses to carry out screen capture operations.  Screen
   capture is inherently CPU-intensive, so ffmpeg will do a better
   job of capturing if it's given full CPU resources.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Temp file folder:</b>  This lets you specify the folder path
   for temporary files created during two-pass video encoding.
   By default, the temp files are created in the same folder as
   the final video.  However, there might be a different folder
   that you'd prefer to use, depending on how your system is set up.
   In particular, if you have a disk that's especially fast or
   that has a lot of extra space, that might be a good place for
   the temp files, because the uncompressed video files created
   during the first pass of a two-pass recording are very large.
   A fast disk is advantageous because FFMPEG has to transfer
   the uncompressed video stream to the drive in real time in
   order to keep up with the live video without dropping frames.
</p>

<p>
   <b>First pass video codec:</b>  This is only used during two-pass
   encoding.  If not blank, this specifies custom video codec
   settings to use during the <b>first</b> pass of the two-pass
   process.  If you lave this blank, PinballY uses default options
   that select an extremely fast codec with minimal compression.
</p>
<p>
   The point of two-pass encoding is to defer most of the CPU-heavy
   compression work until the second pass.  The first pass captures
   the screen video in real time, saving it in a temporary file,
   which the second pass can then go back and compress more
   aggressively.  Since the second pass runs after the real-time
   capture finishes, it can use a lot of CPU without affecting
   the game action.  So the goal of the first-pass codec settings
   is to make the real-time video capture run as fast as possible.
</p>
<p>
   Naively, it would seem like less compression is always faster,
   which is why the default settings (used if you leave this blank)
   apply minimal compression.  It's true that less compression
   generally means less CPU load, but there's a tradeoff for
   real-time capture, which is that uncompressed video is huge,
   so the first pass will have to have to write a lot of data
   to disk very quickly.  This creates another kind of load on
   your system, and depending on how fast your CPU and disk are,
   you might actually get better results if you slightly
   <i>increase</i> the amount of compression during the first
   pass, to reduce the disk transfer load.  That's what this
   option is for: it lets you optimize the settings for your
   system if the default settings don't produce smooth results.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="AudioCaptureDevice"></a>
   <b>Audio capture device:</b>  This lets you select the audio
   input (recording) device to use for media capture operations
   that record audio, such as table audio tracks and table
   videos that include audio.
</p>
<p>
   The drop list shows a list of all of the audio input devices
   currently in your system.  You should choose the one that
   records from the "Line Out" port of your sound card.  This
   is often called "Stereo Mix" or something similar.
</p>
<p>
   If you don't see "Stereo Mix" or some similar device in the
   list, try this:
</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Press <b>Windows+R</b> and type <b>mmsys.cpl</b> into
      the Run box (this should open the Windows "Sound" control panel)
      <li>Click the <b>Recording</b> tab
      <li>Look through the list for a "Stereo Mix" device or something
      similar for your sound card
      <li>If you <i>don't</i> see it, try right-clicking in a blank
      area in the list box, and make sure the menu item for <b>Show Disabled Devices</b>
      is check-marked, and click it if not to check-mark it
      <li>If you find "Stereo Mix" or similar, and it's marked "Disabled",
      right-click it and select <b>Enable</b>
      <li>If you successfully found and enabled the device, you might
      now have to exit out of PinballY and restart the program so that
      it refreshes its internal device list.  After that, you should
      see the device listed in the audio capture options.
   </ul>

<h2>FFMPEG command-line options</h2>
<p>
   This section lets you set the specific options that PinballY
   sends to ffmpeg to perform screen captures.  If you leave these
   blank, PinballY uses its own default settings, which are designed
   for compatibility with most systems.  You can set any combination
   of these to control the capture process more precisely.
</p>
<p>
   The options you specify here are passed through directly to ffmpeg,
   so you'll need a working knowledge of the ffmpeg command syntax
   to use these.  ffmpeg is extremely powerful and has an extremely
   complex command syntax, far beyond what we
   can cover here.  The official ffmpeg documentation is at
   <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html">ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html</a>.
   Extensive user-to-user help can also be found on StackOverflow and
   many other sites; Web searches for "ffmpeg + <i>whatever topic</i>"
   typically turn up lots of results.
</p>
<p>
   The overall ffmpeg command line that PinballY generates is
   constructed like this:
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 2em;">
   <tt>ffmpeg</tt>
     &lt;<i>global-options</i>&gt;
     &lt;<i>video-source-options</i>&gt;
     &lt;<i>audio-source-options</i>&gt;
     &lt;<i>video-or-image-code-options</i>&gt;
     &lt;<i>audio-codec-options</i>&gt;
     &lt;<i>time-limit-options</i>&gt;
     &lt;<i>output-filename</i>&gt;
</p>
<p>
   All of those <i>xxx-options</i> elements correspond to the boxes in the
   dialog, except for the <i>time-limit-options</i>, which is always
   generated internally according to the capture time settings.  When PinballY
   builds the command line, it simply strings together the text you put
   in these boxes to build the overall command line, substituting the
   built-in defaults for each box you leave empty.  Some of the <i>xxx-options</i>
   elements only apply to certain media types; for example, the audio options
   are omitted when you're capturing a still image or a silent video, and
   the video and image options aren't used when capturing an audio track.
</p>
<p>
   Since default options are used for any box you leave blank, you're
   free to customize just the parts you need to, letting the system use
   its defaults for everything else.
</p>

<h3>Substitution variables</h3>
<p>
   Within each element, you can use a number of substitution variables,
   to fill in details that vary in each capture.  A substitution variable
   is written with square brackets:
</p>
<pre>
   -offset_x [left.desktop] -offset_y [top.desktop]
</pre>
<p>
   If you need to use a literal square bracket in option text, write it
   twice, as in <tt>[[</tt> or <tt>]]</tt>.
</p>
<p>
   Here are the available substitution variables:
</p>
<style type="text/css">
#subVarTab td, #subVarTab th {
    border: 1px solid #E8E8E8;
}
#subVarTab td:nth-child(2) {

<p>
   <b>Desktop vs. monitor coordinates:</b>  Variables are provided for
   the capture area location and size in both desktop and monitor
   coordinates, because the coordinate system varies by video source
   mode:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>gdigrab</b> uses desktop coordinates
   <li><b>ddagrab</b> uses monitor coordinates
</ul>

<h3>How to use ddagrab</h3>
<p>
   Newer versions of FFMPEG support a capture mode called <b>ddagrab</b>.
   This is only supported on Windows 8 and later, and only with the 64-bit
   version of FFMPEG, so PinballY's default settings use the older <b>gdigrab</b>
   mode, since it's more universally compatible.
</p>
<p>
   ddagrab captures directly from the GPU video buffer, which gives it
   two advantages over the older gdigrab mode.  The first is that it
   can capture from full-screen-exclusive windows, which gdigrab can't.
   The second is that, because ddagrab reads directly from the GPU,
   FFMPEG can also <i>process</i> the frame directly on the GPU.  FFMPEG
   can perform most of the video encoding process on the GPU if you have
   a compatible NVIDIA card, which greatly reduces the CPU load during
   the capture process.
</p>
<p>
   ddagrab also has a slight disadvantage compared to gdigrab: ddagrab
   can only capture from within the bounds of a single monitor, whereas
   gdigrab can capture an area that spans two or more monitors.  This
   probably isn't a problem for most PinballY users, since most people
   set up their pin cabs with the whole playfield on one monitor, the
   whole backglass on a second monitor, and the DMD on a third (if
   there's a DMD window at all).  But if your setup has one of these
   windows spread across two monitors, ddagrab will only be able to
   capture the portion of that window that fits in its main monitor
   (where its top left corner is located).
</p>
<p>
   You'll have to refer to the FFMPEG documentation for full details
   on how to set up ddagrab captures, but we'll provide two basic "recipes"
   here, one with regular CPU-side encoding, and one with on-GPU encoding.
   The on-GPU encoding is probably always preferable if you can use it,
   but remember that it only works with newer NVIDIA cards.
</p>

<h4>ddagrab with CPU encoding</h4>
<p>
   This option is more broadly compatible than on-GPU encoding, since it
   doesn't require any specific video card.  You just need Windows 8 or later.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Video source options:</b>
   <span class="cmdline">-filter_complex ddagrab=output_idx=[monitorIndex]:offset_x=[left.monitor]:offset_y=[top.monitor]:video_size=[width.monitor]x[height.monitor],hwdownload,format=bgra,[videoTransforms]</span>

   <li><b>Video codec options:</b>
   <span class="cmdline">-c:v libx264 -crf 18</span>

   <li><b>Image codec options:</b>
   <span class="cmdline">-frames:v 1 -update 1</span>
</ul>

<h4>ddagrab with GPU encoding</h4>
<p>
   This option minimizes CPU load by doing most of the video encoding
   on the GPU, but it only works with newer NVIDIA cards with updated
   drivers.  If you have an NVIDIA card and find that this doesn't
   work, try checking on <a href="https://nvideo.com/">nvidia.com</a>
   for an updated driver.  On-GPU encoding requires a fairly recent
   version of the video driver, and Windows Update doesn't automatically
   keep up with all of the latest manufacturer releases.  So don't
   trust Windows Update even if it claims you have the latest.
</p>

<h2>About the Audio Capture Device</h2>

<h4>Why can't PinballY choose a device automatically?</h4>
<p>
   Because Windows doesn't provide a standard device driver for
   this function, and Microsoft didn't even bother to specify
   a standard name for the driver.  You'd think that Windows
   would offer an audio capture function automatically, but it
   doesn't; Microsoft left it up to the sound card manufacturers
   to provide drivers, and left it up to them to name the
   devices.  So there's no way for PinballY to know the name
   of this driver on your system, and in fact no way to even
   know if there's one installed.
</p>
<p>
   "Stereo Mix" is a common name for this driver only because
   it's the name that Realtek uses for its loopback driver,
   and Realtek chips are ubiquitous, especially in
   the built-in audio in many motherboards these
   days.  If your system has integrated audio on the
   motherboard, chances are that it uses the Realtek chips,
   so its driver will probably be called "Stereo Mix".
   But the name might be the translated equivalent of
   "Stereo Mix" if your system is localized to a language
   other than English, or it might be something else entirely.
</p>
   

<h4>What is the "Default" device?</h4>
<p>
   "Default" isn't actually a device in its own right.  It's
   just a way of telling PinballY to select a device automatically,
   which it does by searching the list you see for an entry
   with the words "Stereo Mix" in its name.  If you don't see
   any such device in the list, PinballY won't be able to find
   one either, because it works from the same list you see here.
   So "Default" won't actually work unless you see a suitable
   device listed.  If you see a device with a similar name,
   or a version of "Stereo Mix" translated into your system's
   localization language, you should explicitly select that
   item, because PinballY won't be able to figure it out on
   its own based on the different name.
</p>

<h4>What if the audio device list <i>only</i> shows "Default"?</h4>
<p>
   If "Default" is the only device you see in the audio capture
   device drop list, you won't be able to capture audio when
   recording screen shots.  As described above, "Default" isn't
   actually a device, it's just our way of telling PinballY to
   choose a device by searching for one with "Stereo Mix"
   in its name.  If you don't see a "Stereo Mix" device in the
   list, PinballY won't be able to find one either.
</p>
<p>
   So what can you do about it if the list is empty, or if
   there aren't any suitable capture devices?  The answer is
   that you have to install a suitable device driver.
</p>
<p>
   In some cases, it's just a matter of enabling a device
   that's disabled in the Windows audio control panels.  Some
   sound cards come with Stereo Mix or equivalent devices
   and disable them by default.  To check for disabled devices,
   open the Windows sound control panel and go to the Recording
   tab.  Look for a device called Stereo Mix or something similar;
   if you find it, enable it, and try again in PinballY.
</p>
<p>
   If the Windows sound control panel doesn't list any Stereo
   Mix or equivalent devices, you'll have to find and install
   a device driver capable of recording from the Line Out port.
   This usually has to come from your
   sound card manufacturer, so check the support site for
   your sound card or your PC vendor to see if they have a
   Stereo Mix or "audio loopback" device driver you can use.
</p>
<p>
   If your sound card simply doesn't have any options available,
   there are some third-party software options available, such as
