<h1>mainWindow Object</h1>

<p>
   <b>mainWindow</b> is a pre-defined PinballY object representing the main user
   interface window (the "playfield" window).  This window is the event target
   for most UI-related events, and in many ways it serves as the Javascript
   object that represents the overall PinballY application.
</p>

<h2>Class inheritance structure</h2>
<p>
   This object is an instance of the <a href="SecondaryWindow.html">common window base class</a>,
   so it has all of the behavior defined in that class, in addition
   to its own methods and properties (see below).
</p>
<div>
   <a href="WindowObjects.html">Basic Window Object</a> &rarr;
   <div class="indented">
      mainWindow
   </div>
</div>


<h2>Event target</h2>

<p>
   mainWindow is an event target object, so you can use the standard
   event methods (on(), off(), addEventListener(), etc) to add and remove
   event listeners.  See <a href="EventTarget.html">EventTarget</a>.
</p>
<p>
   mainWindow serves as the event target for the following event types:
</p>

<div class="eventTargetTOC" data-eventtarget="mainWindow BaseWindow"></div>

<a name="drawingLayers"></a>
<h2>Drawing layer ordering</h2>

<p>
   The system displays graphics in several layers in the main window.
   If you use custom <a href="DrawingLayer.html">drawing layers</a>, you
   can interleave your graphics with the system's graphics by using the
   Z index when creating a layer.  Here's the order of the layers,
   from back to front:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Main background image or video
   <li>Custom drawing layers with Z index 0 to 999
   <li>Underlay
   <li>Custom drawing layers 1000 to 1999
   <li>Status line text
   <li>Custom drawing layers 2000 to 2999
   <li>Wheel images
   <li>Custom drawing layers 3000 to 3999
   <li>Game info box (the summary of the current game selection that appears when the UI is idle)
   <li>Custom drawing layers 4000 to 4999
   <li>Video overlays and popup boxes
   <li>Custom drawing layers 5000 to 5999
   <li>Menus and credit/coin messages
   <li>Custom drawing layers 6000 and above
   <li>Drag-and-drop feedback graphics
</ul>


<h2>Methods and properties</h2>

<p>
   The mainWindow object provides the <a href="WindowObjects.html#common">common
   window methods and properties</a>.  It also provides the additional
   items listed below.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="createMediaWindow"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.createMediaWindow(<i>desc</i>):</b>
   Creates a new media window.  This lets you add custom media display windows of
   your own alongside the standard backglass window, DMD window, topper window, and
   instruction card window.  Custom media windows act just like the built-in windows,
   the only difference being that you can specify exactly what kind of media to
   show in a custom window.  Custom media windows also have full support for
   <a href="DrawingLayer.html">drawing layers</a>, just like the built-in windows,
   so you can further specialize these windows with your own custom-programmed graphics.
</p>
<p>
   For an example of how to use this method, see
   <a href="CustomMediaWindowExample.html">Custom Media Window</a> in
   the <a href="WorkedExamples.html">Worked Examples</a> section.
</p>
<p>
   The <i>desc</i> argument is an object, with a collection of properties
   describing the new window.  All of the properties are optional, but in
   most cases you'll want to at least specify the title and configuration
   file prefix.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>title:</b> a string giving the window's title, as displayed in
   its Windows title bar and in system menus where it appears (such as the
   right-click context menu in the main playfield window, where an item is
   automatically added to show the window.

   <li><b>configVarPrefix:</b> a string giving the prefix for the variables
   in the PinballY settings file that store the window's location and layout
   information between program sessions.  To work properly with the settings
   mechanism, be sure to limit this to alphanumeric characters, underscores,
   hyphens, and periods.  Don't use any other special characters, and don't
   use spaces.  The variables in the settings file related to this window
   will all start with this string, with various suffixes starting with a
   period (".") attached.

   <li><b>parent:</b> an HWND object (window handle) giving the "parent
   window" for the new window.  If you omit this, the default parent is
   the main playfield window, which is almost always what you'll want
   this to be anyway, so you can just omit this property unless you're
   trying to achieve some specific effect.  You can find out more about
   the notion of parent windows in the Microsoft API documentation.
   The main thing effect of the parent relationship in PinballY is
   that a window is always kept in front of its parent window, even
   when the parent window is the active window.  Using a null window
   handle makes the window a top-level window, so it can be moved
   in front of and behind any of the other windows.

   <li><b>backgroundImageMediaType:</b> a string giving the media type
   to use for the window's background image.  This lets you tell the
   system to automatically search for and load a background image
   associated with the currently selected game each time a new game
   is selected.  You can use any of the pre-defined media types
   (see <a href="MediaTypes.html">Media Types</a>
   for a full list), but more interestingly, you can define your own
   custom media types via <a href="GameList.html#createMediaType()">gameList.createMediaType()</a>.
   A custom media type lets you create a new media folder hierarchy alongside
   the standard ones - table images, backglass videos, and so on.
   For example, you could create a custom media type for pictures
   of the full original pinball machines, and then create a custom
   media window to display the full machine picture for the
   current game.
   <p>If <b>backgroundVideoMediaType</b>
   is also set, the window will look for a video first, and will
   only look for a still image if no video is found.  If the video
   type isn't set, the window will ignore videos and just look
   for still images.
   </p>
   <p>If this property isn't set, the default is that the window
   doesn't automatically load any background image at all.  This is
   suitable if you plan to provide your own custom graphics in the
   window using <a href="DrawingLayer.html">Drawing Layers</a>.

   <li><b>backgroundVideoMediaType:</b> a string giving the media type
   to use for the window's background video.

   <li><b>defaultBackgroundImage:</b> a string giving the name of the
   default image file to use if no background image matching the
   media type specified in <b>backgroundImageMediaType</b> is found
   for a selected game.  This defaults to "Default Custom".  The
   system searches for an image file with this name in the same
   places that the built-in windows look; see
   <a href="DirectoryInfo.html#DefaultMediaFiles">Default media files</a>
   in <a href="DirectoryInfo.html">Files &amp; Folders</a> for details.
   This should be given as just the bare, root filename, with no
   folder path and no extension.  The system has a standard set of
   places to look and extensions to try when searching for this,
   which it adds to this base name to form full filenames to seek.

   <li><b>defaultBackgroundVideo:</b> a string giving the name of
   the default video file to use if no background video is found
   for a selected game.  This works like <b>defaultBackgroundImage</b>
   above.  The default value is "Default Custom".

   <li><b>startupVideo:</b> a string with the name of the startup
   video to play in this window.  This is just the root filename
   of the video, without any path prefix and without any extension
   (that is, <b>don't</b> include .mp4 or .mov at the end).  The
   system looks in the usual places for startup videos; see
   <a href="StartupAudioVideo.html">Startup Audio and Video</a>.  In
   order for a startup video to be displayed, the window must be
   created before any startup videos start playing, which means
   it has to happen during the initial Javascript loading process.

   <li><b>isMediaCapturable:</b> an optional boolean value indicating
   whether or not the window should be included in screen capture
   operations, to create background image and video media by
   capturing screen shots of a running game.  The default is false,
   to disable media capture in this window.  This should only be
   set to true for a window type that represents something that
   a running game will display on-screen, since the point is to
   create media by recording the running game's video displays.

   <li><b>showMediaWhenRunningKey:</b> an optional string giving
   the "key" to use to decide whether or not to continue showing
   the window's media while a game is running.  This should be
   a short string, and must not use any special characters.
   For reference, the built-in windows use the keys
   "bg", "dmd", "realdmd", "topper", and "instcard", so something
   along those lines is recommended: descriptive and short.
   This is stored in the settings file as well as the game
   stats file to keep track of per-game and per-system
   settings for the window.  This is optional; if not specified,
   the window will use the default behavior of clearing to black
   and moving into the background whenever a game is running.
   You can also control this behavior through Javascript code,
   via the <a href="CustomWindow.html#showMediaWhenRunningFlag">showMediaWhenRunningFlag</a>
   property of the custom window object.
</ul>
<p>
   The return value of the method is the newly created window object,
   which has methods and properties described in
   <a href="CustomWindow.html">CustomWindow</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The descriptor <i>desc</i> doesn't contain any window position, size,
   or visibility information.  That's intentional.  A custom media window
   is a first-class window with all of the standard functionality that
   comes with the built-in media windows, so one of the things that the
   system will do automatically with this window is to save and restore
   its layout information.  When you create the window, its layout
   information will be restored from the settings file, so that the
   window appears at the same location where the user left it at the
   end of the last session.  Of course, there's no saved information
   to be restored when you create a window for the first time, so the
   window is simply shown at a default position.  If you want to
   override the saved location every time you create the window in
   a new session, you can use the <a href="OptionSettingsObject.html">optionSettings</a>
   object to update the window's settings variables just before you
   open the window.  Recall that the window's variables all start
   with the <b>configVarPrefix</b> string you specify when creating
   the window.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="doButtonCommand"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.doButtonCommand(<i>command</i>, <i>down</i>, <i>repeatCount</i>):</b>
   Simulates a key press, or more precisely, simulates a processed key event
   that corresponds to <a href="CommandButtonEvent.html">CommandButtonEvent</a>.
   This carries out the effect of a named button command, specified by the
   string <i>command</i>.  The valid command names are the values listed for the
   .command property of the <a href="CommandButtonEvent.html">CommandButtonEvent</a>
   object.  <i>down</i> is a boolean indicating if this simulates a key press
   (true) or a key-up event (false) representing the user releasing the key.
</p>
<p>
   <i>repeatCount</i> is an integer indicating if the simulated event represents
   an initial key press or an auto-repeated key press (that is, repeated key
   events generated when the key is being held down).  0 represents an initial
   key/button press (not yet auto-repeated), 1 represents the first auto-repeat,
   2 is the second auto-repeat, and so on.
   <i>repeatCount</i> is only meaningful when <i>down</i> is true, for obvious
   reasons.
</p>
<p>
   Because the simulated key press is coming from Javascript already,
   it doesn't generate any of the usual Javascript events for actual key presses;
   it just carries out the effect of the key command.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="doCommand"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.doCommand(<i>id</i>):</b>  Executes the command specified by
   <i>id</i>, which is one of the integer command codes in the
   <a href="Commands.html">Commands</a> set.  This function carries out a
   menu-level command, as opposed to a button-level command; for the latter,
   use doButtonCommand().
</p>

<p>
   <a name="DOFPulse"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.DOFPulse(<i>name</i>):</b>  Pulses the named DOF event.  This
   turns the effect "on" (by setting its "brightness" level in DOF to the
   maximum value of 255), then turns the effect back off (by setting the
   DOF brightness value to 0) after a brief interval.  This is the normal
   way in DOF to trigger the lighting or tactile effects associated with an
   "event".  In a simulated pinball game, a DOF event would represent a
   specific, momentary action in the game, such as "the ball hit the Extra Ball target".
   In a PinballY context you might use this to represent a discrete user action, such as
   "pressed the left flipper button" or "navigated to a new game".
</p>
<p>
   You can connect events fired with this method to actions in your
   DOF Config Tool configuration by using the same event name in the
   Config Tool, adding the <b>$</b> prefix in the Config Tool rule.
   For example, if you write <tt>mainWindow.DOFPulse("MyEvent")</tt>
   in Javascript, the corresponding rule in the DOF Config Tool syntax
   would refer to the event as <tt>$MyEvent</tt>, because the Config Tool
   uses the <b>$</b> prefix to refer to named events.
   See <a href="DOFEvents.html">DOF Events</a> for more.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="DOFSet"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.DOFSet(<i>name</i>, <i>value</i>):</b>  Sets the given
   named DOF event to the given value, from 0 (off) to 255 (full "brightness").
   The setting stays in effect until you change it with another call to
   DOFEffect() using the same name and a different value.
</p>
<p>
   You can connect events fired with this method to actions in your
   DOF Config Tool configuration by using the same event name in the
   Config Tool, adding the <b>$</b> prefix in the Config Tool rule.
   For example, if you write <tt>mainWindow.DOFSet("MyEvent", 255)</tt>
   in Javascript, the corresponding rule in the DOF Config Tool syntax
   would refer to the event as <tt>$MyEvent</tt>, because the Config Tool
   uses the <b>$</b> prefix to refer to named events.
   See <a href="DOFEvents.html">DOF Events</a> for more.
</p>
<p>
   Be careful about timing.  DOF effects require a little time padding between
   consecutive changes to a given effect's value, because DOF operates on its
   own "clock", and only checks for updates periodically.  If you update the
   same named event twice in a row too quickly, DOF might not notice the
   change and might not trigger the desired hardware effects.
   For cases where you want to represent a momentary action in the UI, such
   as "user pressed left flipper button", it's almost always better to use
   DOFPulse(), since that automatically paces the ON-OFF sequence at a speed
   that DOF can handle.
</p>
<p>
   This function doesn't coordinate at all with PinballY's own DOF event
   generation, so it's easiest to use this for your own custom events, using
   unique names that aren't part of PinballY's own named DOF event set
   (see <a href="DOFEvents.html">DOF Events</a>).  You can use any names
   you want for named DOF events, so you're free to invent as many new
   events as you like representing whatever actions you like.
   You <i>can</i> also use this to update PinballY's own named
   events, but since PinballY updates those events itself, this
   could cause unpredictable interactions.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="endAttractMode"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.endAttractMode():</b>  Exits "Attract Mode" if it's currently
   active.  There's no effect if the program isn't already in attract mode.
   The <a href="AttractModeEvent.html"><b>attractmodeend</b></a> event isn't
   fired when you use this method.
</p>
<p>
   <a name="getActiveWindow"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.getActiveWindow():</b>  Returns the <a href="WindowObjects.html">window object</a> (mainWindow,
   <a href="BackglassWindow.html">backglassWindow</a>, etc) corresponding to the
   current active window in the application.  This is the active window at the
   operating system level, which means that it's in the foreground and has
   keyboard focus.  If the application is currently in the background, none
   of the windows are active, so this returns null.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getKeyCommand"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.getKeyCommand(<i>descriptor</i>):</b>  Returns an array of
   the button commands assigned to the given key or joystick button.  <i>descriptor</i>
   is an object describing the key or button to look up.  This can be in one of the
   following formats:
</p>
<div class="code">
{ type: "key", vkey: <i>integer</i> };  // look up by virtual key (vkey) from key event
{ type: "key", code: <i>string</i> };   // look up by key code from key event
{ type: "joystick", unit: <i>integer</i>, button: <i>integer</i> };  // joystick button
</div>
<p>
   This is the same information provided to your event listener in a
   <a href="KeyEvent.html">KeyEvent</a> or <a href="JoystickButtonEvent.html">JoystickButtonEvent</a>
   object, so it's easy to look up the command information in one of those
   handlers.
</p>
<p>
   The command names in the returned array are the same names used in the
   .command property of the <a href="CommandButtonEvent.html">CommandButtonEvent</a>
   object.  An array is returned because it's possible for a user to assign multiple
   commands to the same keyboard key or joystick button.  Pressing a key with multiple
   commands assigned carries out each of the commands in sequence.
</p>
   
<p>
   <a name="getUIMode"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.getUIMode():</b>  Returns an object describing the current UI
   state.  Here's a quick summary of the object's contents:
</p>
<div class="code">
{
    mode: "wheel",         // see list
    game: (object),        // GameInfo object for currently selected game in wheel
    menuID: "main",        // see list; present only in "menu" mode
    popupID: "about box",  // see list; present only in "popup" mode
    runMode: "running",    // or "starting", "exiting"; present only when a game is running
    capture: "single"      // or "batch"; present only when running a game in media capture mode
}
</div>
<p>
   The main state is given by the property .mode, which has one of the values
   listed below.  Depending on the mode, other properties of the object might
   be present to provide additional information.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>"wheel": in the normal game wheel UI, awaiting a command

   <li>"menu": a menu is being displayed (this refers to the graphical
   menu that PinballY displays as an overlay in the playfield window, not
   a standard Windows menu).  In this case, the .menuID property of the
   mode object will contain a string identifying which particular menu
   is being displayed.  See <a href="Menus.html#systemMenus">system menus</a>
   for a list of the built-in menus and their identifiers.

   <li>"popup": a popup box is being displayed.  The .popupID property of
   the mode object is a string specifying the type of popup.  See
   <a href="Popups.html#systemPopups">system popups</a> for a list
   of the system popup types.

   <li>"running": a running game is in progress.  Note that "menu" mode can
   supersede this, since the user can still bring up menus while a game is
   running.  You can determine for sure whether or not a game is running by
   checking for the presence of another property, .runMode, which will be
   present if and only if a game is running.  If present,
   .runMode will be set to the string "starting" (the game has been launched
   but hasn't opened its UI window yet), "running" (the game is in progress),
   or "exiting" (PinballY has closed the game and is waiting for the process
   to exit).  In addition, if the game is running for the purposes of media
   capture, the property .capture will be present, and will be set to the
   string "single" for a single-game capture or "batch" for a batch capture.

   <li>"attract": attract mode/screen saver mode (meaning that there hasn't
   been any user input for the period of time configured in the settings to
   activate attract mode)
</ul>
<p>
   The .game property identifies the game that's currently selected in
   the wheel, if any.  This is present regardless of which UI mode is
   in effect.  This is a <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object,
   which has properties that access the game's details.
   The .game property will be omitted (so it'll read as undefined) if no
   game is selected, which can only happen when the wheel is completely
   empty.  The wheel can be empty when the program can't find any
   installed games, or when a filter is selected that doesn't match
   any games.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="launchOverlay"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.launchOverlay:</b> This read-only property contains an object
   representing the launch overlay, which displays graphics showing the status
   during game launches.  This lets you customize the graphics shown
   during the launch process.  <b>launchOverlay</b> has two properties, giving
   you access to the two drawing layers of the launch overlay:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>fg:</b> an object representing the foreground layer
   <li><b>bg:</b> an object representing the background layer
</ul>
<p>
   Each of those objects in turn has methods that let you show graphics in
   its layer.  The foreground layer (<b>mainWindow.launchOverlay.fg</b>) is,
   as the name suggests, the front layer; the background layer (<b>bg</b>) is
   immediately behind it in the drawing order.  These are the topmost layers
   overall, so they're draw in front of the wheel UI and the playfield
   background.  If you draw an opaque background into either window, it'll
   cover up everything else in the UI.
</p>
<p>
   The reason we have two layers for this one overlay is that it lets the
   system (or your Javascript code) draw some fixed graphics in the background
   layer, and then update the message in the foreground layer at each stage
   of the process, without having to redraw the background.  This is more
   efficient than redrawing the whole background on every update,
   and it's also nice if you want to show a video, since videos can't be
   directly combined in one layer with other graphics.  You can use the
   background layer for a video that plays throughout the loading process,
   for example, while status messages are drawn on top of the video via
   the foreground layer.
</p>
<p>
   The launch overlay is only displayed during game launches.  Accessing it at
   other times will have no effect.  In most cases, you'd use this object in
   listeners for the <a href="LaunchOverlayEvent.html">LaunchOverlayEvent</a>
   group of events.
</p>
<p>
   The <b>fg</b> and <b>bg</b> objects are <a href="DrawingLayer.html">DrawingLayer</a>
   objects.  You can draw graphics into them the same way you would with a drawing
   layer that you created explicitly in your scripting code via
   <a href="WindowObjects.html#createDrawingLayer">createDrawingLayer()</a>.  However, since
   PinballY itself creates and manages the <b>fg</b> and <b>bg</b> objects,
   there are a few differences to be aware of:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>These layers only exist during the launch process, so you can't draw
   into them at other times
   <li>PinballY itself draws graphics in these layers during the launch process,
   which might replace any graphics you draw if you don't intervene via the
   <a href="LaunchOverlayEvent.html">LaunchOverlay events</a>
   <li>Because these are system-created layers, you can't remove them with
   <a href="WindowObjects.html#removeDrawingLayer">removeDrawingLayer()</a>
   <li>You also can't move or resize the layers - they're always stretched
   to exactly fill the window's height and width
</ul>

<p>
   <a name="message"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.message(<i>message</i>, <i>style</i>):</b>  Shows a message
   using a graphical popup box in the main window.  Unlike the global alert()
   function, this doesn't pause the script until the user acknowledges the
   message; it simply shows or queues the message and returns immediately.
   This is a good option for showing error messages or status updates, since
   it doesn't interrupt the flow of the user interface with a modal dialog.
   If <i>style</i> is provided, it's a string value specifying the
   visual style of the popup message.  This can be "info", "warning", or
   "error", to show the message with green, orange, or red trim
   (respectively), to visually signal the nature of the message.  The
   regular "info" style is used if <i>style</i> is omitted.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="playGame"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.playGame(<i>game</i>, <i>options</i>):</b>  Launches a game.
   <i>game</i> is a <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object for the game to
   be launched.  <i>options</i> is an object with properties specifying option
   settings; this whole argument can be omitted, in which case defaults are
   used for all options.  If you do include the object argument, you only
   have to specify the properties for options you want to override; any
   missing properties will use the corresponding defaults.  Here are the
   possible <i>options</i> properties:

<ul>
   <li><b>command:</b>  An integer giving the command code that the game is
   nominally launched under.  The default is
   <a href="commands.html#PlayGame">command.PlayGame</a>, which is also
   the command that the system itself uses to launch games for normal
   play (as opposed to media capture).  The command you specify here has
   no effect on how PinballY itself handles the launch process, but it's
   reported to your event handlers as the command code in all of the
   <a href="LaunchEvent.html">LaunchEvent</a> events reported that fire
   during the launch, so you can use it as the basis of any custom
   handling you want to perform during the launch.

   <li><b>system:</b>  A <a href="GameSysInfo.html">GameSysInfo</a> object
   specifying which system to use to launch the game.  The default
   is the system associated with the game in the game database, or the
   system associated with the table directory where the game file is located.
   If it's not possible for PinballY to uniquely determine the system from
   one of those sources, you <b>must</b> specify this option to tell the
   program which system to use.  Note that PinballY doesn't try to second-guess
   your choice of system here; it'll let you run any game file with any system.
   But for obvious reasons, the launched program will probably show an error,
   crash, or otherwise fail to work properly if you try to launch it with
   a game file designed for a different system.

   <li><b>overrides:</b>  An optional object value specifying overrides for
   the normal launch parameters.  The parameters are specified via the
   object's properties.  These are the same
   properties that can be set in the <b>override</b> property
   of a <b>prelaunch</b> event; see <a href="LaunchEvent.html#overrideProperties">override properties</a>
   for the list of properties and their meanings.
   <p>
      You can specify any
      subset of the override properties.  The normal system launch parameters
      are used for any properties you omit from the override set.  For example,
      if you want to change the "show window" mode but use the rest of the
      normal the launch parameters unchanged, you could do something
      like this:
   </p>

   <div class="code">
mainWindow.playGame(game, undefined, { swShow: SW_HIDE });
   </div>
   
</ul>

<p>
   <a name="setUnderlay"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.setUnderlay(<i>filename</i>, <i>options</i>):</b>  Display a new underlay
   in the main window's wheel UI.  This loads the image file specified by <i>filename</i>
   and displays it as the new underlay.  Use an empty string ("") to remove the underlay
   image.
</p>
<p>
   <i>options</i>, if present, is an object specifying additional
   layout details for the underlay.  This lets you override the normal layout
   parameters for an individual underlay file, in case you want to customize
   the size or position of each underlay file separately.  If the <i>options</i>
   object is omitted entirely, all of the layout parameters use the settings
   from the configuration.  If you do provide an <i>options</i> object, you
   don't have to include all of the properties listed below - just the ones
   you want to override.  Any properties not included in your  <i>options</i>
   object use the defaults, taken from the configuration.  Any values you
   specify in the <i>options</i> object override the settings for duration of
   this underlay display (so the overrides remain in effect even if the
   user edits the option settings or resizes the window).  The options only
   last for the duration of this single underlay display; they aren't persistently
   attached to the file or anything crazy like that.  The following properties
   can be specified:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>height:</b> The display height of the underlay in the window, as
   a percentage of the total window height.  E.g., the value <b>20.5</b> specifies 20.5%
   of the window height.

   <li><b>maxWidth:</b> The maximum display width of the underlay, as a percentage
   of the window height.  The underlay is normally stretched to the full width
   of the window, but <b>maxWidth</b> can be used to limit the stretch, to set
   a limit on how far the aspect ratio is distorted.  This can be useful to
   prevent excessive distortion when the window
   is much wider than it is tall (as in typical landscape mode displays).

   <li><b>yOffset:</b> The distance from the bottom of the window to use to position
   the underlay vertically, as a percentage of the window height.
</ul>
<p>
   See also <a href="UnderlayEvent.html">UnderlayEvent</a>, which describes the event
   fired when the system is about to initiate its own change to the underlay because
   of a new game selection in the wheel UI.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="showMenu"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.showMenu(<i>id</i>, <i>items</i>, <i>options</i>):</b>  Displays a custom
   menu in the main window, in the same style as the main menu, exit menu, etc.
   See <a href="Menus.html">Menus</a> for more details.  The <a href="MenuEvent.html"><b>menuopen</b></a>
   event isn't fired when you use this method.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="showPopup"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.showPopup(<i>desc</i>):</b>  Displays a custom popup dialog
   in the main window, in the style of the standard system popups (e.g., game
   information, high scores, ratings entry).   See
   <a href="Popups.html#custom">Custom Popups</a> for more details.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="showWheel"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.showWheel(<i>show</i>):</b> Shows or hides the game wheel
   display.  If <i>show</i> is true, the function shows the wheel; if <i>show</i>
   is false, the wheel is hidden.  The system hides the wheel itself at certain
   times, such as when "attract mode" is active and the options are set to
   hide the wheel in attract mode; in these cases, showing the wheel through
   this function will have no immediate effect.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="startAttractMode"></a>
   <b>mainWindow.startAttractMode():</b>  Enters "Attract Mode", the screen saver
   mode that normally kicks in automatically when there hasn't been any keyboard
   or mouse input for some amount of time (the exact amount of time is configurable
   in the settings).  This function lets you explicitly enter Attract Mode from
   Javascript code, so that you can create your own custom conditions for
   triggering the mode, separately from the system's normal handling.  For
   example, you could use this to enter attract mode when a certain key
   is pressed, or from a custom menu selection.
   The <a href="AttractModeEvent.html"><b>attractmodestart</b></a> event isn't
   fired when you use this method.
</p>

<p>
   <b>mainWindow.statusLines:</b>  An object containing references to the
   <a href="StatusLine.html">StatusLine</a> objects representing the on-screen
   status line displays.  The object has the following properties:
</p>
<ul class="compact">
   <li><b>upper:</b>  The upper line of the main two-line status area
   <li><b>lower:</b>  The lower line of the main two-line status area
   <li><b>attract:</b>  The single-line status area that replaces the main status
   area when attract mode is active
</ul>
