<h1>System Functions</h1>

<p>
   In addition to the standard Javascript built-in functions, PinballY
   provides a number of its own functions for access to system
   features.  These are described below.
</p>
<p>
   Many of these are similar to the like-named functions in a Web
   browser.  We've tried to use the same names and behavior when there's
   a good conceptual match between the way a browser works and the way
   PinballY works.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="alert"></a>
   <b>alert(<i>message</i>):</b>  Shows a system dialog box with the given
   message text.  This pops up a standard modal Windows message box with an OK
   button, and pauses the script until the user dismisses the dialog.  This
   can be handy for script debugging, but it should be avoided for anything
   else, as it doesn't fit very well with PinballY's pin cab interaction
   style.  See message() for a friendlier alternative for alerting the
   user, and <a href="LogfileObject.html#log">logfile.log()</a> for another
   option for debug messages.
</p>
<p>
   <b>clearInterval(<i>id</i>)</b>:  Cancels an interval event created
   with setInterval().  The <i>id</i> value is the value returned from
   setInterval() when the event was created.  This removes the event and
   prevents any pending execution from occurring.  It's harmless to
   cancel an interval that doesn't exist or that has already been canceled.
</p>
<p>
   <b>clearTimeout(<i>id</i>)</b>:  Cancels a pending timeout event
   created with setTimeout().  The <i>id</i> value is the value returned
   from setTimeout() when the event was created.  This removes the event
   and prevents any pending execution from occurring.  It's harmless
   to cancel a timeout that doesn't exist or that has already been canceled.
   This will also have no effect if the timeout has already been executed,
   since you can't "take back" the previous execution.
</p>
<p>
   <b>createAutomationObject(<i>name</i>)</b>:  Creates an OLE Automation
   object of the given class name.  Automation objects are scripting
   language interfaces provided by Windows and by various applications.
   This is similar to the Visual Basic function CreateObject().
   See <a href="OLEAutomation.html">OLE Automation</a> for more
   details.
</p>
<a name="message"></a>
<p>
   <b>message(<i>message</i>, <i>style</i>):</b>  This is an alias for
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#message">mainWindow.message()</a>.
</p>
<p>
   <a name="setInterval"></a>
   <b>setInterval(<i>function</i>, <i>interval_in_milliseconds</i>)</b>:  Sets
   up an interval event, which invokes the given function periodically, at
   (approximately) the specified interval.  Each the time function is invoked,
   the internal event timer is automatically reset so that the event will
   be called again after another interval of the same time elapses.  The
   function returns an ID value that can be used to cancel the repeating
   event via clearInterval().  Like Javascript in a browser, PinballY's
   Javascript is single-threaded, so an interval event can't "interrupt" an
   executing script; if the next scheduled event time happens to occur
   while another script is executing, the interval function will be invoked
   when the current script finishes.
</p>
<p>
   <a name="setTimeout"></a>
   <a name="setTimeout"></a>
   <b>setTimeout(<i>function</i>, <i>timeout_in_milliseconds</i>)</b>:  Sets
   up a timeout event, which invokes the given function once, after the given
   interval elapses.  The function returns an ID value that can be used to
   cancel the timeout before it executes via clearTimeout().  As with
   Javascript in a browser, PinballY's Javascript is single-threaded, so
   timer events can't "interrupt" other scripts.  If the timeout period
   elapses while another script is running, the function will be invoked
   when the current script finishes.
