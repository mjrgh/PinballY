<h1>instCardWindow Object</h1>

<p>
   <b>instCardWindow</b> is a pre-defined PinballY object representing the
   Instruction Card window in the user interface.   This is a window that can
   be optionally opened to show the apron instruction card for the currently
   selected game at any given time.  (This is a separate top-level window,
   <i>not</i> the separate pop-up graphic overlay that the user can bring
   up within the playfield or backglass window via the "Instructions" command.
   That's not a separate top-level window, just a graphic overlay on those
   other windows.)
</p>

<h2>Class inheritance structure</h2>
<p>
   This object is an instance of the <a href="SecondaryWindow.html">Secondary Window</a>
   class, so it has all of the behavior defined in that class, as well
   as in the <a href="WindowObjects.html">base window class</a>.
</p>
<div>
   <a href="WindowObjects.html">Basic Window Object</a> &rarr;
   <div class="indented">
      <a href="SecondaryWindow.html">Secondary Window</a> &rarr;
      <div class="indented">
         instCardWindow
      </div>
   </div>
</div>


<h2>Event target</h2>

<p>
   The instruction card window object is an event target, so you can use the standard
   event methods (on(), off(), addEventListener(), etc) to add and remove
   event listeners.  See <a href="EventTarget.html">EventTarget</a>.  This
   window receives the following event types:
</p>

<div class="eventTargetTOC" data-eventtarget="SecondaryWindow BaseWindow"></div>

<h2>Methods and properties</h2>
<p>
   This object is a <a href="SecondaryWindow.html">Secondary Window</a>, so
   it inherits the methods and properties defined for that class as well as
   the <a href="WindowObjects.html#common">common window base class methods and properties</a>.
   It doesn't currently have any additional properties or methods beyond the common set.
