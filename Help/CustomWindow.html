<h1>Custom Windows</h1>

<p>
   This type of object represents a window that you create via
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#createMediaWindow">mainWindow.createMediaWindow</a>.
   It's a specialization of the basic <a href="WindowObjects.html">Window Objects</a>
   that the system provides for the main playfield window, the backglass window,
   and so forth.  You can use custom windows to supplement the standard set
   of windows if you have additional media types that you want to display,
   or to display entirely custom graphics using <a href="DrawingLayer.html">Drawing Layers</a>.
</p>
<p>
   For some examples of how to create your own custom windows, see
   <a href="CustomMediaWindowExample.html">Custom Media Window</a> in
   the <a href="WorkedExamples.html">Worked Examples</a> section.
</p>

<h2>Class inheritance structure</h2>
<div>
   <a href="WindowObjects.html">Basic Window Object</a> &rarr;
   <div class="indented">
      <a href="SecondaryWindow.html">Secondary Window</a> &rarr;
      <div class="indented">
         Custom Window
      </div>
   </div>
</div>

<h2>Event target</h2>

<p>
   A custom window object is an event target, so you can use the standard
   event methods (on(), off(), addEventListener(), etc) to add and remove
   event listeners.  See <a href="EventTarget.html">EventTarget</a>.  This
   window receives the following event types:
</p>

<div class="eventTargetTOC" data-eventtarget="CustomWindow SecondaryWindow BaseWindow"></div>

<h2>Properties and methods</h2>

<p>
   Since Custom Windows inherit from the Secondary Window base class,
   they have all of the methods and properties that a Secondary Window
   has, as described in <a href="SecondaryWindow.html">Secondary Windows</a>.
   That class is itself a subclass of the basic common window
   class, so a Custom Window also has the standard window
   functions, described in <a href="WindowObjects.html">Window Objects</a>.
</p>
<p>
   In addition to the inherited functionality, Custom windows also
   have some extended functions of their own, as listed below.
</p>
<p>
   <a name="showMediaWhenRunningFlag"></a>
   <b>showMediaWhenRunningFlag:</b>  This property lets you control
   whether or not the window continues to show media while a game is
   running.  This is the custom window equivalent of the options
   dialog checkboxes that let you control the same behavior for the
   built-in windows.  This can take on three possible values:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>true</b> means that the window continues to show its media
   while a game is running

   <li><b>false</b> means that the window is blanked out and sent to
   the background while a game is running.  This is the default
   behavior for custom windows, and it's also the default for all
   of the system windows, except when you override it using the
   options settings (the "Keep showing this game's media while
   running" checkboxes in the Game Details box, the system setup
   options pages, and the Launch options page).

   <li><b>undefined</b> means that the normal "key" mechanism is
   used.  The system windows use the key to store the per-game,
   per-system, and global preferences set through the various
   settings dialogs, by checking the status of the key in the
   global settings file and the Game Stats file.  If you defined
   a key for this window when creating it (see <b>showMediaWhenRunningKey</b>
   undef <a href="MainWindowObject.html#createMediaWindow">mainWindow.createMediaWindow()</a>),
   the system uses the same key search for this custom window.
   If you didn't define a key string for the window when creating
   it, <b>undefined</b> has the same meaning as <b>false</b>,
   yielding the default behavior of blanking out the window while
   a game is running.
</ul>
<p>
   Note that values of <b>true</b> and <b>false</b> override any
   "key" lookup, so you can use these to control the behavior
   unconditionally in Javascript code.  For example, you could
   use a <a href="GameSelectEvent.html"><b>gameselect</b></a>
   event to decide on how to handle the window for the current
   game each time a new game is selected, setting
   <b>showMediaWhenRunningFlag</b> to the desired value.
