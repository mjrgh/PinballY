<h1>Javascript Scripting</h1>

<p>
   PinballY includes a full Javascript engine for user scripting customizations.
   Many of the things that PinballY does automatically can be overridden
   or customized through Javascript code.
</p>
<p>
   The Javascript engine has access to a lot of PinballY events and features,
   but not all of them, since the system has to provide Javascript hooks
   for the specific features that are to be made scriptable.
   If there's something we've missed that you'd
   like to customize from Javascript, let me know.  The Javascript interface
   can be extended to almost any area of the program, so capabilities
   that aren't currently there could be added in the future according
   to interest.
</p>

<p>
   The underlying Javascript engine is ChakraCore, Microsoft's high-performance,
   standards-compliant Javascript engine, which Microsoft built for their Edge
   browser and released as open source.   It has top-tier performance and
   implements modern Javascript standards, including all ES6 language features:
   "let", "class", "for..of", destructuring assignments, "arrow" (=&gt;)
   functions, template literals, promises, the spread operator, and typed arrays.
   Microsoft is no longer investing in ChakraCore development, since they've
   adopted Google's Chromium as the foundation for their Web technologies, but
   since it's open-source, it can live on in PinballY.
</p>


<h2>Is this like Web browser Javascript?</h2>

<p>
   Yes and no.  PinballY's Javascript <i>language</i> is exactly
   the same as the Javascript language in a modern Web browser.
   But the programming environment is somewhat different.
   Some of the common objects and functions that you might think of as
   "native Javascript" aren't actually that.  They're really "native
   Web browser" things.  For example, the "document" and "window" objects
   in browser Javascript come from the browser, not from Javascript, so
   you won't find them in PinballY, nor will you find an HTML DOM tree,
   nor common Web browser events like "onclick" and "onchar".
   Instead, PinballY provides its own, somewhat different set of objects
   that represent the PinballY user interface environment.  With that in
   mind, we've tried to maintain familiar names and concepts wherever
   we can.  For example, PinballY's event system is similar to a browser's,
   and a number of common browser-like functions are available, such as
   timeouts and intervals.  At the same time, we've intentionally used
   new names for things that might resemble browser features but aren't
   quite the same conceptually, to avoid creating the false impression
   that they'd work exactly the same way.
</p>

<h2>Javascript language documentation</h2>

<p>
   I won't attempt to write a Javascript tutorial or reference manual,
   since you can easily find better ones on the Web than I could write.  PinballY
   uses standard Javascript, so the information in any Javascript language
   manual should apply.  One good place to look is the
   <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</a>:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript documentation on MDN</a>
</div>
<p>
   But remember that PinballY doesn't have the
   usual complement of Web browser environment objects ("document",
   the HTML DOM tree, etc).  A lot of "Teach Yourself Javascript"
   Web sites think that Javascript is always about Web development,
   so they might take it for granted that you're working in a
   browser.  This is gradually changing, as Javascript has been
   gaining popularity for server programming and in other
   contexts, thanks to systems such as Node.js.  But many online
   tutorials and examples still assume that Web browser objects
   are an integral part of the language, so you might have to
   adjust source code examples you find online accordingly.
</p>


<h2>How to enable scripting</h2>

<p>
   You don't have to change any option settings to enable scripting.
   It's always enabled; to use it, you just place a Javascript
   source file in a certain location.  Specifically, you place a
   file called <b>main.js</b> in the <b>Scripts</b> folder within your
   main PinballY folder.  PinballY always automatically checks for
   this file at startup.  If PinballY finds <b>Scripts\main.js</b>
   when it starts up, it loads the file and executes it.
</p>
<p>
   What goes in main.js?  In general terms, any valid
   Javascript code.  But practically speaking, what you'll usually do here
   is set up some "event listeners" for PinballY's program events.  Event
   listeners are functions that you write in Javascript for PinballY
   to call when particular events happen in the user interface.  If
   you've ever done any Web browser Javascript programming, you'll
   recognize that as the same basic approach that you'd use there.
   The only difference is that you're working with PinballY's event
   scheme in this case rather than with Web browser events.
</p>
<p>
   If you wish, you can organize your code into multiple files.
   This is particularly useful if you want to share your code
   or use modules written by other people.  See <a href="#multipleFiles">How to
   use multiple script files</a> later in this section.

<h2>Overall program flow</h2>

<p>
   When PinballY starts up, it loads the <b>main.js</b> file that
   you provide.  Javascript immediately executes all of the code in
   the file that's defined outside of any function or class
   definitions.
   If you're familiar with more traditional programming languages
   like C or C++, you can think of this "outer" Javascript code as the
   equivalent of the "main" routine that's executed at program startup
   in a C or C++ program.
</p>
<p>
   The main thing that the top-level code in your main.js file
   will usually do is set up <i>event listeners</i>.  An event
   listener is a function you write that will be called when a
   specific event occurs.  Once an event listener is set up,
   PinballY will call it whenever the associated event occurs.
</p>

<h2>Events</h2>

<p>
   Most of the code you write for PinballY will be there to handle
   events.  An event is something like "the user pressed a key"
   or "a game is being launched".
</p>
<p>
   A function you write to handle an event is called an
   <i>event listener</i>.  PinballY notifies you that
   something is happening by calling your event listeners for
   that particular event.
</p>
<p>
   If you've used Visual Basic or C#, you might expect that
   event handlers are set up by using a special function name
   when you define an event handler function.  That's not how it works
   in Javascript.   Instead, you set up each handler explicitly,
   so you can use any name for any handler function.
</p>
<p>
   You set up an event listener by calling a function to add
   the listener to the <i>event target</i> object that generates
   the events of interest.  An event target represents a PinballY
   user interface element that's associated with one or more
   events.  The primary event target for most events is the
   <b>mainWindow</b> object, which represents the main playfield
   window.  Most UI events are handled in this window, even
   when other windows (such as the backglass or DMD) are open.
</p>
<p>
   To attach an event listener to an event target, you use the
   <b>on()</b> method of the event target object:
</p>

<div class="code">
// This is an event listener function for "key down" events.  The
// name doesn't matter, because we're going to call on() in a moment
// to register the listener.  (This isn't like Visual Basic, where
// event handlers are tied to special function names.)
function myListener(event)
{
   // do something with the key-down event
}

// &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Here's where we register our listener! &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; 
mainWindow.on("keydown", myListener);

// Event listeners don't even have to be named at all.  You can use
// anonymous functions, like this:
mainWindow.on("keydown", function(ev) { /* do something with the event */ });

// Using the more succinct "arrow" function notation
mainWindow.on("keydown", ev => { /* handler */ });
</div>

<p>
   You can attach a listener to more than one event with a single "on" call,
   by separating the event names with spaces:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("keydown keyup", ev => { /* this is called for both keydown and keyup events! */ });
</div>

<p>
   <b>on()</b> <i>adds</i> a listener.  It doesn't replace or
   remove existing listeners for the same event.  If there's already another
   event listener on the same object, the old listener and the new
   listener will both be called when the event occurs.  You can add any
   number of listeners this way.  This is especially useful if you're
   mixing packages written by different people, because it lets
   listeners from different packages co-exist peacefully, without
   having to know about each other.
</p>
<p>
   There's variation of <b>on()</b> called <b>one()</b>, which
   adds a listener that only runs a single time.  The first time a
   "one" handler is called, it runs normally, then the system
   automatically removes it.
</p>

<p>
   You can remove an event listener explicitly via the <b>off</b>
   method:
</p>
<div class="code">
   mainWindow.off("keydown");
</div>
<p>
   Calling <b>off()</b> with an event name simply removes all listeners
   for the given event name.  You can remove a specific
   listener by passing in the same function you used to set up the
   listener in the first place with <b>on()</b>:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.off("keydown", myListener);
</div>

<p>
   You can specify a "namespace" with each event created with <b>on()</b>.
   A namespace is specified after the event name, separated with a period (.).
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("keydown.MyPlugin", (ev) => { /* handler */ });
</div>

<p>
   The point of a namespace is to identify the listener
   for later removal.  When you call <b>off()</b>, you can 
   use the same namespace qualifier to remove only the listener(s)
   created with that namespace:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.off("keydown.MyPlugin");   // removes only the MyPlugin handler(s)
</div>

<p>
   Remember, the normal <b>off()</b> removes <i>all</i> listeners for the
   named event.  Using a namespace qualifier removes only listeners
   with the same namespace.  This is especially useful for sharing code,
   because it lets you make nicely isolated code that won't interfere with
   other people's code that it's combined with.
</p>
<p>
   Using a namespace also lets you easily remove every event listener
   of every type that you installed under the namespace.  Just call <b>off()</b>
   with the namespace qualifier alone, with no event name:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.off(".MyPlugin");  // removes every mainWindow event with a .MyPlugin namespace
</div>

   to the methods for adding and removing event listeners to event
   target objects like <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a>.

   <li><a href="Event.html">Event</a>, for a reference to the properties
   and methods of the Event object that's passed as a parameter to each
   event listener.  The Event object describes the details of the event,
   such as which key was pressed.
</ul>

<h2>System objects and classes</h2>

<p>
   PinballY provides access to the program environment through a number
   of pre-defined system objects.  These are analogous to the system
   objects in a Web browser ("window", "document", etc), but are tailored
   to the PinballY environment instead of a browser environment.
   See <a href="SystemObjects.html">System Objects</a> for details.
</p>
<p>
   In addition, the system provides some additional functionality
   through pre-defined system classes.  These are object classes that
   you and/or the system can instantiate to carry out operations
   beyond the normal scope of Javascript's type system.
   See <a href="SystemClasses.html">System Classes</a> for details.
</p>

<h2>Built-in functions</h2>

<p>
   All of the standard Javascript built-in functions are implemented in
   the ChakraCore engine.  You can find documentation on those in any
   Javascript reference.  In addition, PinballY provides a number of
   its own built-in functions for access to the program environment
   and to replicate some of the basic built-in features in Web browsers,
   such as timeouts and intervals.  See <a href="SystemFunctions.html">System Functions</a>
   for details.
</p>

<h2>File system access</h2>
<p>
   Javascript doesn't have any built-in access to the local file system,
   since Javascript is most widely used in browsers, where file system
   access isn't just unsupported, it's actively blocked, due to the security
   risks it would create.  But PinballY is obviously a very different
   context, and it does give you a couple of ways to access files.
</p>
<p>
   The easiest is to use FileSystemObject, a standard Windows scripting component.
   You can access this using PinballY's <a href="OLEAutomation">OLE Automation</a>
   support.  FileSystemObject provides simple scripting access to basic file
   functions, such as getting directory listings and reading and writing text files.
</p>
<div class="code">
let fs = createAutomationObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject");
</div>

<p>
   If you need lower-level access, or more advanced functions beyond what
   FileSystemObject provides, you can call most native Windows API functions
   directly via the <a href="DllImport.html">DLL Import</a> system.
</p>
   

<h2>HTTP requests</h2>
<p>
   You can use Javascript to send HTTP requests to Web sites and process
   the results.  See <a href="HttpRequest.html">HttpRequest</a> for
   details.
</p>

<h2>Performance tip: avoid long-running operations</h2>

<p>
   Avoid operations in Javascript that will take a long time to complete,
   especially things like timing loops or waiting for external calls
   (such as network reads) to complete.  "A long time" means anything
   long enough for you to perceive on a human scale, which is anything
   longer than about 30 to 50 milliseconds.   Javascript
   runs as part of the main user interface thread, so any lengthy operation
   in Javascript can make the UI appear to be frozen for as long as the operation
   takes to complete.  This can cause the video to momentarily freeze or
   stutter, and can also delay the processing of button inputs enough
   to make the response feel sluggish or laggy.
</p>
<p>
   Instead of using timing loops or waits, use a timeout or interval.
   That'll let PinballY run the UI while waiting for the scheduled time.
   If you have a long-running, CPU-intensive task to perform, try to
   break it up into smaller tasks, and use intervals to spread the
   subtasks out over time.
</p>
<p>
   When waiting for an external event, such as a network request,
   always use some kind of asynchronous mechanism, rather than
   polling for completion.  Javascript Promise objects were designed
   specifically for such situations, but you can also use ad
   hoc approaches, such as checking periodically with timeouts
   or intervals.
</p>

<h2>Debugging</h2>

<p>
   A good debugger is indispensable for any non-trivial programming
   project.  PinballY doesn't have a debugger UI built in, but it
   has something better: support for connecting an external debugger
   of your chocie.  You can use it with Visual Studio Code
   (Microsoft's free code editor and Javascript IDE) as well as
   the Chrome DevTools debugger (built into the Chrome browser).
   For details on setting up a debugger, see
   <a href="JsDebug.html">Javascript Debugging</a>.
</p>


<a name="multipleFiles"></a>
<h2>How to use multiple script files</h2>

<p>
   By default, PinballY only loads one file, Scripts\main.js.  But that
   doesn't mean that you have to cram all of your scripting code into that
   one place.  You can use the standard Javascript ES6 <b>import</b>
   command to load additional modules.  This lets you mix and match
   feature modules created by other users, and lets you create your
   own individual feature modules to share.
</p>
<p>
   (Don't confuse the Javascript ES6 <i>import</i> command with the
   <a href="DllImport.html">DLL import</a> system.  The DLL import feature is
   a PinballY add-on, not standard Javascript.  The standard <b>import</b>
   command imports other Javascript files, whereas the DLL import
   scheme lets you access native code in external DLLs.)
</p>
<p>
   The import system is specifically
   designed to make it easy to combine code written by different people,
   by letting you say exactly which symbols (and only those) are shared
   among modules.  That avoids all sorts of problems that <i>usually</i>
   come up when people try to share code, such as when two people
   both used the same names for their variables and functions.
</p>
<p>
   The basic Javascript import syntax looks like this:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   import { <i>function-or-object-name</i> } from "<i>module.js</i>";
</div>
<p>
   You can import multiple symbols from the module by listing them
   inside the braces, separated by commas.
</p>
<p>
   There's a lot more to the "import" syntax than this, including a
   dynamic form (the import() function) that lets you import code
   conditionally or at specific points in time.  Refer to a Javascript
   language reference for full details.
</p>

<h2>Calling external DLL functions</h2>

<p>
   PinballY's Javascript has extensions that let you call
   external native code in DLLs (dynamic link libraries).
   The system is unlike most "plug-in" systems in that you
   can call most native code directly from Javascript,
   even if the native code you're calling was never written
   with PinballY in mind.  In particular, you can use the
   extensions to call most Windows APIs directly from
   Javascript, with no external C or C++ code required.
   You can also use it to add your own custom code to PinballY,
   written in any native-code language, without having to build
   PinballY from source.   You just compile your code into a DLL,
   and call your DLL from Javascript using these same extensions.
   See <a href="DllImport.html">DLL Imports</a> for details.
</p>

<h2>Browser frameworks (jquery, etc)</h2>

<p>
   Web Javascript frameworks like jQuery generally <b>won't</b>
   work in PinballY.  That's because Web browser frameworks
   depend heavily on the Web browser HTML document structure and
   event model.  As we've already discussed, those don't exist in
   PinballY.  But jQuery in particular has influenced some of the
   pre-defined framework in PinballY's Javascript environment,
   so some of the concepts carry over in general terms, even if
   the exact details can't.
</p>

<h2>System script files</h2>

<p>
   Many of the classes, objects, and functions that constitute 
   PinballY's Javascript "application environment" are implemented
   in Javascript, so you can easily view the code to see what it's
   doing, in case you need any details beyond what's covered in
   this section.  You can even change the system code if you have
   some unusual situation that requires such drastic measures,
   although that's strongly discouraged, for the obvious reason that
   it will make it harder to update to a new release.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY's system scripts are in the <b>Scripts\System</b> folder
   within your PinballY program folder.  These files are automatically
   loaded when PinballY starts up (or, in some cases, later on when
   needed), so there's no need to copy any of these files into your
   own .js files or to load them explicitly with "import" or any
   other means.  You can simply expect these files to be available
   at all times.
</p>
<p>
   A quick summary of the files:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>SystemClasses.js:</b>  The main application environment
      classes, such as the <b>mainWindow</b> object and the 
      event handling classes.

   <li><b>CParser.js:</b>  Code that parses C-style function and
      struct definitions for use in the DllImport system.
</ul>
