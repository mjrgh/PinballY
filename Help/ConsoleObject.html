<h1>console Object</h1>

<p>
   <b>console</b> is a pre-defined PinballY object that lets you
   display text messages on the debugger's console window when you're
   using a debugger (see <a href="JsDebug.html">Debugging</a>).  This
   provides a simple way of seeing what's going on in your code when
   troubleshooting scripts.  The PinballY console object is similar
   to the console object in a Web browser, with most of the same
   methods.
</p>


<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>
   In the method descriptions below, "display" always means
   displaying on the debugger console.  If you're not currently
   using a debugger, there is no console, so any messages are
   simply discarded.  You can thus leave console logging messages in
   working code without bothering the user with extraneous messages.
   Even so, it's good practice to remove console messages when
   you're confident about a section of code and no longer need
   to instrument it: there's still some overhead in processing
   the method calls, and when you want to debug some other area
   of the code, you don't want to sift through the noise of
   leftover messages from unrelated areas.
</p>

<p>
   <b>console.assert(<i>assertion</i>, <i>arguments...</i>):</b>
   If the <i>assertion</i> expression is false (or "falsey"), the
   function acts like console.log(), displaying the arguments the
   same way log() would.  Otherwise nothing is displayed.  This can
   be used to log messages when unexpected conditions occur.
</p>

<p>
   <b>console.count(<i>label</i>):</b>  Displays the number of times
   that this method has been called with the same label.  If the label
   is omitted, a default label based on the calling code location is used
   instead; this can be used to count the number of times a particular
   line of code is executed.
</p>
<p>
   <b>console.countReset(<i>label</i>):</b> Resets the counter associated
   with the given label, for the purposes of console.count().
</p>
<p>
   <b>console.error(<i>arguments</i>):</b> Does the same thing as console.log(),
   but displays the message with special styling (that depends on the debugger)
   to indicate that it's an error messages.
</p>
<p>
   <b>console.exception(<i>arguments</i>):</b>  Identical to console.error().
</p>

<p>
   <b>console.format(<i>formatString</i>, <i>arguments</i>):</b>  Formats the
   printf-style "%" parameters in the format string, using the given arguments,
   and returns the resulting string.  This uses the same formatting codes
   described for console.log().  This lets you access the special formatting
   features directly for messages displayed in other places besides the
   console.
</p>
   
<p>
   <b>console.info(<i>arguments</i>):</b> Does the same thing as console.log(),
   but displays the message with special styling (that depends on the debugger)
   to indicate that it's an informational message.
</p>

<a name="log"></a>
<p>
   <b>console.log(<i>object</i>...)</b>:  Displays a message on the
   console log by converting each object to its string representation
   (using toString()), and appending the strings together, separated
   by spaces.  This is typically used to display simple string
   messages:
</p>

<div class="code">
console.log("This is a log messages!");
</div>

<a name="sprintfLog"></a>
<p>
   <b>console.log(<i>formatString</i>, <i>arguments...</i>):</b>
   If the first argument to console.log() is a string, and it contains
   one or more "printf"-style "%" format codes, console.log() interprets
   it as a format string with substitution variables.  Each "%" code is
   replaced with a formatted version of the corresponding argument
   from the <i>arguments</i> list, in left-to-right order.
</p>
<p>
   Here's how the printf-style format string is interpreted:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   <p>
      <b>Format codes:</b>  Each format code starts with a "%" and
      ends with a letter indicating the data format to be used to
      format the corresponding argument.  The main format codes are:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li><b>%O</b>: object format.  The corresponding
      argument is treated as an object and converted to a string with
      toString(), and the result is substituted for the %O.  null and
      undefined and rendered as "null" and "undefined", respectively.

      <li><b>%o</b>: octal <i>or</i> object format.  If the argument is
      an object, this acts like %O, with the object converted to string
      via toString().  Otherwise, this 

      <li><b>%d</b> or <b>%i</b>: decimal integer format.  The corresponding
      argument is formatted as an integer (any fractional part is
      discarded), in decimal radix (base 10).

      <li><b>%x</b> or <b>%X</b>: hex integer format.  The corresponding
      argument is formatted as an integer (any fractional part is
      discarded), in hexadecimal radix (base 16).  %x renders
      hex digits A-F in lower-case, while %X renders them in
      upper-case.

      <li><b>%b</b>: binary integer format.  The argument is formatted
      as any integer (truncating any fractional part) in base 2.

      <li><b>%f</b>: floating point format.  The argument is formatted
      as a floating point number value.

      <li><b>%s</b>: string.  If the argument isn't a string, it's converted
      to string via toString().

      <li><b>%S</b>: string, but with more explicit conversions for arguments
      that aren't already strings.  Non-string arguments are converted to a
      format that's designed to help with troubleshooting, by listing the
      properties of objects, and showing the exact types of the Javascript
      "falsy" values:
      <ul class="compact">
         <li>numbers are converted using the normal Javascript toString() default formatting
         <li>booleans are converted to "true" or "false"
         <li>null is converted to "null"
         <li>undefined is converted to "undefined"
         <li>arrays are formatted as a list of values enclosed in square brackets
         <li>objects are formatted as a list of "property: value" pairs enclosed in curly braces
      </ul>

      <li><b>%%</b>: a single "%" sign is substituted.  Use this to
      insert a literal "%" in the result string.
   </ul>

   <p>
      <b>Flags, width, precision:</b>  You can include three optional
      elements before the format code characters: flags, width, and
      precision.  These are specified like so:
   </p>
   <div class="indented">
      <b>%</b> <i>flags</i> <i>width</i> <b>.</b> <i>precision</i> <i>format-code</i>
   </div>

   <p><b>Flags:</b></b>
   <ul>
      <li><b>-</b>: left-justify the value in the available width
         meaning that any needed padding is added at the end of the
         numeric value.  E.g., "%-7d" formats 100 as "100"
         followed by four spaces.  The default is to right-justify,
         with extra spaces at the beginning of the number.

      <li><b>+</b>: for numeric types (%d, %i, %x, %X, %f), show a
         "+" sign if the value is positive.  E.g., <b>%+d</b> formats
         100 as "+100".

      <li><b><i>space</i></b>: for numeric types, insert a space at the
         beginning of the number if it's non-negative (so that positive and
         negative values use the same overall width).  E.g., "%&nbsp;d"
         formats 100 as "&nbsp;100" (note the leading space).

      <li><b>#</b>: for the non-decimal numeric format codes, adds a C++/Javascript-style
      prefix to indicate the radix:
      <table class="veryCompact dataTable" style="margin: 1ex;">
         <tr><th>Format</th><th>Prefix</th><th>Example</th></tr>
         <tr><td>%#b</td><td>0b</td><td>0b1011011</td></tr>
         <tr><td>%#o</td><td>0</td><td>01777</td></tr>
         <tr><td>%#x</td><td>0x</td><td>0x9f07</td></tr>
         <tr><td>%#X</td><td>0X</td><td>0X9F0A</td></tr>
      </table>

      <li><b>0</b>: for numeric types, if padding is required by the width
         specifier, use leading zeroes instead of spaces.  For example,
         "%05d" formats 100 as "00100".
   </ul>

   <p>
      <b>Width:</b>  
      This specifies the <i>minimum</i> width for the format.
      This works for all types except %o and %O, which ignore it.
      The width is given as an integer value, as in "%5d".
      If the formatted value is shorter than the minimum given
      by the width, padding is added, in the form of leading
      or trailing spaces.  For the numeric formats, the padding
      is added as leading zeroes ("0" characters) if the "0"
      flag is specified; for strings, padding is always spaces.
      The width is a minimum only, not a maximum; values that
      exceed the width aren't truncated.
   </p>
   <p>   
      For example, "%5d" formats 100 as "&nbsp;&nbsp;100" (with two leading spaces).
   </p>

   <p>
      <b>Precision:</b>
      This is a number specified after a "." in the format
      string: it's the "3" in "%.3f" or "%7.3f".
   </p>
   <p>
      For %f, the precision specifies the number of digits to
      show after the decimal point.  Values are rounded if
      necessary.  For example, "%.3f" displays 123.456789
      as "123.457".
   </p>
   <p>
      For integer formats, the precision simply has the effect
      of left-justifying the result instead of right-justifying it.
   </p>
   <p>
      For strings, the precision gives the maximum width.  If
      the string is longer, it's truncated.
   </p>
</div>
   
<p>
   <b>console.time(<i>label</i>):</b>  Starts a timer under
   the given label.  This establishes the starting time for
   elapsed time measurements using console.timeLog() and console.timeEnd().
</p>
<p>
   <b>console.timeEnd(<i>label</i>):</b>  Displays on the console
   the current elapsed time for the timer previously started under the
   given label with console.time(), and then removes the timer.
</p>
<p>
   <b>console.timeLog(<i>label</i>):</b>  Displays on the console
   the current elapsed time for the timer previously started under
   the given label with console.time().
</p>

<p>
   <b>console.trace()</b>: Displays a call stack trace for the calling code.
</p>

<p>
   <b>console.warning(<i>arguments</i>):</b> Does the same thing as console.log(),
   but displays the message with special styling (that depends on the debugger)
   to indicate that it's a warning message.
