<h1>StyledText</h1>

<p>
   StyledText is a built-in class for arranging and displaying text
   that contains a mixture of styles, such as different fonts and sizes.
   The text can also contain in-line images, which are laid as though
   they were part of the text.
</p>
<p>
   This class is a higher-level alternative to the basic text drawing
   primitives that the <a href="CustomDrawing.html">Custom Drawing</a>
   system provides.  The basic text functions operate at the much simpler
   level of drawing individual strings, each in a single style.  That
   works for simple graphics with plain text that's static enough that
   you can position and arrange it in advance, but it's impractical
   for text that uses a mixture of styles, since you'd have to do all
   of the alignment calculations and word-wrapping manually.
</p>
<p>
   StyledText lets you construct a text stream containing a mixture
   of fonts and styles, and does all of the word-wrapping and alignment
   calculations necessary to lay out the text in a given screen area.
   You can then measure the space needed to display the whole block of
   text, and display the whole block with a single method call.
</p>
<p>
   StyledText works with the Custom Drawing system, so you can combine
   it with the other drawing primitives to create complex layouts
   that incorporate styled text as well as other graphics.  StyledText
   amounts to an extended version of the
   <a href="CustomDrawing.html#drawText">drawText()</a> method in the
   custom drawing context.
</p>
<p>
   You might also take a look at <a href="HtmlLayout.html">HtmlLayout</a>,
   which is another way of handling mixed-style text.  HtmlLayout has more
   extensive layout capabilities than StyledText that include most of the
   core HTML and CSS layout features.  The interface to HtmlLayout is
   also rather different, in that you set it up using HTML/CSS source
   code, as though you were creating a Web page.  StyledText has a more
   programming-oriented interface.  Each approach is more convenient
   for certain kinds of tasks, so you can choose the one that works
   better for your use case.
</p>

<h2>How to use StyledText</h2>
<p>
   The first step is to create a StyledText object to hold the mixed-style
   text you wish to display.  Do this by using the Javascript <b>new</b>
   operator to create the object:
</p>
<div class="code">
let s = new StyledText();
</div>

<p>
   Optionally, you can pass an object to the constructor, to specify
   the visual styling for the text block.  That lets you select the
   text alignment (left, centered, right, justified), set a background
   fill color for the whole block of text, and set the default font
   style to use for text within the block.  See
   <a href="#constructor">new StyledText()</a> below for details.
</p>
<p>
   A StyledText object doesn't need a Drawing Layer or Custom Drawing
   context.  It's just a container for the styled text itself, so it's
   not directly tied to any particular window or drawing operation.
   You can create one at any time and hold onto it indefinitely,
   even when a drawing operation isn't in effect.  Likewise, you can
   reuse the same StyledText object to draw the same text in different
   drawing contexts.
</p>
<p>
   Once you've created a StyledText object, you add text to the layout
   by calling the <b>add()</b> method on the object:
</p>

<div class="javascript code">
s.add("Styled Text Demo");
</div>

<p>
   Each bit of text you add is appended to any text you added
   previously, so you can build up the overall layout by adding each
   piece of text in turn until the text is complete.
</p>
<p>
   When you pass a string to <b>add()</b>, it adds the text using
   the default font style.  You can specify a specific font style
   to use as the default when creating the StyledText object with
   <b>new</b>.
</p>
<p>
   But StyledText wouldn't be very different from the
   <a href="CustomDrawing.html#drawText">drawText()</a>
   primitive if this was all you could do!  The whole point
   of StyledText is to use a mixture of styles within one block
   of text.  So each time you call <b>add()</b>, you can also optionally
   specify a specific style to use for just that one fragment
   of text being added.  You do this by calling <b>add()</b>
   with a descriptor object instead of just a simple string:
</p>

<div class="javascript code">
s.add({ font: "Tahoma", size: 30, weight: 700, text: "Some big, bold text!" });
</div>

<p>
   That adds the text in the specified font, size, and weight.
   Other properties you can set include <b>style</b>, to select
   italics, oblique, or regular text; <b>underline</b> and
   <b>strikethrough</b>, to set text decorations; <b>color</b>,
   to set the text color; <b>backgroundColor</b>, to set the
   background fill color for the string; and <b>stretch</b>,
   to set the horizontal width of the font, from condensed
   to extended.  See the <a href="#add">add()</a> method
   for full details on what can go in the descriptor.
</p>
<p>
   You don't have to specify all of those properties every
   time you add text.  You just have to specify the ones that
   you want to customize for that particular string.  Any of
   the style properties you include will override the defaults,
   and any that you leave out will use the defaults.
</p>
<p>
   You can also "nest" styles within styles.  The <b>text</b>
   property can itself be another descriptor, where you add more
   styles:
</p>
<div class="javascript code">
s.add({ font: "Tahoma", text: {
        size: 30, text: "Big Tahoma Text!"
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   That might not look all that useful: after all, you could
   have just put that all in one descriptor, right?  Well, it
   turns out that there's yet an other option for <b>text</b>,
   which is that it can be an array of multiple strings and/or
   descriptors.  That's where the nesting becomes really useful.
   It lets you activate a style for a series of text fragments,
   which can then add their own individual styles to the
   "parent" style:
</p>
<div class="javascript code">
s.add({
    font: "Tahoma",
    size: 30,
    text: [
        { weight: 700, text: "Bold!" },
        { style: "italic", text: "Italics!!" },
        { weight: 700, style: "italic", text: "Bold Italics!!!" }
    ]
});
</div>

<p>
   In the example above, all three text fragments are displayed
   in 30-point Tahoma, but the first is in boldface, the second
   is in italics, and the the third is in bold and italics.
</p>
<p>
   You can continue that nesting to any depth.  Just use another
   array-of-descriptors as the inner <b>text</b> property.
</p>
<p>
   One little note about these examples: <b>add()</b> doesn't
   insert any spaces beyond what you explicitly tell it to,
   so all of the text we've been inserting will just run
   together.  In actual use, you'll usually want to include
   spaces between adjacent strings, unless you actually want
   them to run together without any spacing.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Using images:</b>   You can include in-line images that
   are formatted along with the text.  This is useful for things
   like icons and bullets that aren't part of a font.  To add
   an image to the text flow, call
   <b>add()</b> with a descriptor that includes an <b>image</b>
   property instead of a <b>text</b> property.  The <b>image</b>
   property lets you specify the file containing the image to
   display, and other properties to size and align the image.
</p>
<div class="javascript code">
s.add({ image: { src: "GameIcon.png" }});
</div>

<p>
   <b>Drawing the text:</b>  Once you've added all of the text
   to the StyledText object, you're ready to draw it.  To do this,
   you use the standard <a href="CustomDrawing.html">Custom Drawing</a>
   procedure.  As always, you have to write a "drawing function"
   and pass it to the appropriate system function to initiate drawing,
   such as the <a href="DrawingLayer.html#draw">draw()</a> method on
   a <a href="DrawingLayer.html">DrawingLayer</a> object.  Your drawing
   function receives a <a href="CustomDrawing.html#drawingContext">drawing context</a>
   object as its argument, and this object is needed to
   draw the StyledText layout.
</p>
<p>
   Once you're in a custom drawing function and have a
   drawing context object available, drawing the StyledText
   is just a matter of calling its <b>draw()</b> method.
   The arguments to this method are the drawing context
   object, and the boundaries of the rectangular area within the
   window where you want to display the text: left coordinate,
   top coordinate, width, and height, all in pixels.
</p>
<p>
   For example, this draws styled text in a Drawing
   Layer object, positioning it at the top left, and giving it
   full run of the available space:
</p>
<div class="javascript code">
myDrawingLayer.draw(dc => {
    let size = dc.getSize();
    s.draw(dc, { x: 0, y: 0, width: size.width, height: size.height });
}, 640, 480);
</div>

<p>
   <b>Measuring the text:</b>  One of the key things StyledText can
   do for you is automatic word-wrapping, taking into account the
   different styles of the text and the
   bounds of the drawing area.  You can measure
   the effect of word-wrapping using the <b>measure()</b>
   method of the StyledText object, specifying the width of the
   available space.  That'll figure the word-wrapping break
   points and tell you (among other things) how much vertical
   space is needed to fit the resulting text.  It'll also
   tell you the actual width needed, which might be a
   little different from the bounding-box width you
   specified, since the word breaks might fall in such
   a way that none of the lines fully fill out the
   available width (and, in some cases, text that can't
   be broken across lines might exceed the available width).
</p>
<div class="code">
// measure the layout bounds with a width of 250 pixels
let metrics = s.measure(250);
</div>
<p>
   The measure() method returns an object with properties
   <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> giving the required display
   size of the text.
</p>
<p>
   The returned object has another property, <b>drawingArea</b>,
   giving a rectangle indicating the bounding box of all of
   the pixels affected by the text display.  This has properties
   <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, <b>width</b>, and <b>height</b>.  The
   <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> in <b>drawingArea</b> might
   be slightly different from the main <b>width</b> and
   <b>height</b> values returned, since the ones in
   <b>drawingArea</b> reflect the actual pixel area, as
   opposed to the text layout area.
</p>
<p>
   In most cases, you can just ignore this <b>drawingArea</b>.
   The <b>width</b> and <b>height</b>
   usually tell you everything you need to know to arrange
   the text display on the screen.  But the drawing area
   might be useful in some special cases, so it's included
   in case you need it; read on if you're curious.
</p>
<p>
   The difference between the drawing area and the layout
   area is a technicality of the way computerized
   fonts are constructed.  Computer fonts are laid out using
   rectangular "character cell" boxes.  A given font's cells
   are always the same height, but they can vary in width -
   the cell for an "M" is usually wider than for an "i",
   for example.  The cells are used to line up the glyphs
   on a line of text, and to space them out horizontally.
   The complication with "overflow" is that some glyphs
   aren't completely confined to their cells.  Some fonts
   have glyphs that spill out slightly.   This is especially
   common with decorative fonts, which often have "swashes"
   or ligatures that intentionally overlap with nearby characters
   and therefore have to spill outside of their cells a
   little bit.  It's also common with italic and oblique
   typefaces, since the tilt often pushes a little bit
   of each glyph outside of its rectangular cell.  The
   main <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> properties returned
   from <b>measure()</b> only cover the bounds of the
   area needed for all of the character cells.  If any
   of the glyphs at the outside spill out of their
   cells, the <b>drawingArea</b> box will reflect the
   larger area needed to account for all of the pixels.
   Conversely, if all of the glyphs are not only confined
   to their character cells, but don't even reach the
   edges of their cells, <b>drawingArea</b> will reflect that
   by being slightly smaller than the rectangle implied
   by <b>width</b> and <b>height</b>.
</p>
<p>
   The main use I can think of for the drawing area is
   clipping.  If you need to clip the StyledText display
   to a limited area (to avoid having it overlay adjacent
   graphics, for example), the drawing area rectangle is
   important because it tells you the full pixel extent
   of the text.  If you clip to the layout width and
   height, you might chop off a few pixels at the
   edges where glyphs extend slightly outside their
   cells.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Interaction with other drawing primitives:</b>  StyledText
   does its actual drawing using a <a href="CustomDrawing.html">Custom Drawing</a>
   graphics context, just like all of the Custom Drawing functions,
   so you can freely combine it with the other drawing functions
   to build up composite graphics out of different elements.
   Drawing styled text simply draws pixels into the in-memory
   bitmap that the drawing function is constructing, just like
   drawing a simple text string via the drawing context's
   <a href="CustomDrawing.html#drawText">drawText()</a> method.
</p>
<p>
   In the absence of explicit background colors, StyledText uses
   a transparent background.  This makes it easy to overlay
   styled text on top of other graphics.  Draw the background
   material first, then draw the StyledText object to draw
   the text over the background.
</p>
<p>
   StyledText <b>doesn't</b> affect of the text-related "status" elements
   in the drawing context.  It doesn't use or affect
   the text origin, text bounding box, of any of the font, size,
   style, or color attributes in the drawing context.  All of the
   style and positioning information in a StyledText object is
   self-contained.
</p>

<h2>Properties and methods</h2>
<p>
   A StyledText object has the following properties and methods:
</p>

<p>
   <a name="constructor">
   <b>new StyledText(<i>desc</i>):</b>  Create a new StyledText
   object.  <i>desc</i> is an optional descriptor object specifying
   the overall block-level style, and the default font styling for
   text added to the object.  It has the following properties,
   all optional:
   <ul>
      <li><b>backgroundColor</b>:  A number giving the background
      color to draw for the whole text area, in hex 0xAARRGGBB format -
      alpha, red, green, blue.  Each component is a hex number from
      00 to FF (decimal 0 to 255).  An alpha of 0 is completely
      transparent, and FF is completely opaque.  If you don't
      specify a background color, the background is transparent,
      allowing you to layer the text over other background material
      you draw separately into the drawing context.

      <li><b>cornerRadius</b>:  A number giving the radius (in pixels)
      to use for rounding the corners of the background fill.  This only
      matters if you specify a non-transparent background color.

      <li><b>padding</b>:  A number giving the amount of blank space
      (in pixels) to leave around the perimeter of the text.  The text
      is indented on all sides by this amount from the rectangle you
      specify when you draw it.  If there's a background fill color,
      the background fill extends out to include the padding space.
      <p>
         Optionally, instead of specifying a single number with the
         padding all around, you can specify the padding on each side
         individually.  Do this by specifying an object for <b>padding</b>,
         instead of just a number, with the properties <b>left</b>, <b>right</b>,
         <b>top</b>, and <b>bottom</b>, each a number, giving the padding
         in pixels on that side.  Any that are omitted default to zero.
      </p>

      <li><b>textAlign</b>:  One of the strings "left", "right", "center",
      or "justified", specifying the horizontal alignment for text in
      the block.

      <li><b>textStyle</b>:  An object, containing any of the text
      styling properties that can be used in the <b>add()</b> descriptor:
      font, size, sizePx, weight, stretch, underline, strikethrough,
      style, color, backgroundColor.  These all have the same usage and
      meaning as when used in <b>add()</b>, and they establish the
      default style used for all text that doesn't specify other
      values when added.  The defaults if you don't specify any
      styling are 10-point Arial, regular weight and style, black
      text with a transparent background.
   </ul>

   <a name="add"></a>
   <b><i>styledText</i>.add(<i>desc</i>):</b>  Adds text to the layout.
   If <i>desc</i> is a string, the text in the string is simply added to
   the layout, using the default style.  If <i>desc</i> is an array,
   each element of the array is added to the layout, one at a time,
   as though you had called <b>add()</b> with each element of the
   array individually.  <i>desc</i> can also be a descriptor object,
   with the following properties, all of which are optional:

   <ul>
      <li><b>backgroundColor</b>:  A number giving the background
      color for the text span, as an 0xAARRGGBB value - alpha, red,
      green, blue.  Each element is a hex value from 00 to FF
      (decimal 0 to 255).  An alpha value of 00 is completely
      transparent, meaning no background will be drawn at all.  The
      background only affects this run of characters, not the
      whole StyledText area.

      <li><b>color</b>:  A number giving the color for the text, as an
      0xAARRGGBB value - alpha, red, green, blue.  Each element is a hex
      value from 00 to FF (decimal 0 to 255).  An alpha of 00 is
      completely transparent, and FF is completely opaque.

      <li><b>font</b>: A string giving the name of the font to use
      for this text element.

      <li><b>image</b>:  Inserts an inline image into the text stream.
      This is mutually exclusive with <b>text</b> and <b>nbsp</b>.
      The property value is an object with the following properties:
      <ul>
         <li><b>height:</b>  An optional number giving the pixel height
         to use when drawing the image.
         <li><b>src:</b>  A string giving the filename of the image.
         This is required.
         <li><b>verticalAlign:</b>  A string indicating how to align
         the image vertically within the line of text.  This can be
         "top", "bottom", "middle", or "baseline".  Baseline alignment
         means that the image's bottom edge is aligned with the text
         baseline, which is the bottom of the glyphs on the line not counting
         "descenders" (the little curlicues that extend below some
         lower-case letters, like "g" and "j").
         <li><b>width:</b>  An optional number giving the pixel width to
         use when drawing the image.
      </ul>
      <p>
         If both <b>width</b> and <b>height</b> are included, the
         image is drawn at the exact size specified.  If both are
         omitted, the actual size of the image is used.  If one
         is specified and the other isn't, the one that's
         missing is chosen to maintain the image's original aspect ratio.
      </p>
      

      <li><b>nbsp</b>:  Any value.  If this property is present (regardless
      of the value), it inserts a non-breaking space into the text.  This appears
      as a space character visually, but unlike an ordinary space,
      it prevents a word-wrapping line break before or after the
      space.  This is mutually exclusive with <b>image</b> and <b>text</b>.

      <li><b>size</b>: A number giving the font size, in <b>points</b>, for
      this text element.

      <li><b>sizePx</b>: A number giving the font size, in <b>pixels</b>, for
      this text element.

      <li><b>stretch</b>:  A number giving the horizontal "stretch" of the font,
      from 1 to 9, where 5 is normal.  Some fonts provide a range of widths
      from condensed (narrower than normal glyphs) to extended (wider than normal).
      Most Windows fonts only come in a single "normal" width, but some
      professional-level fonts have more variability.

      <li><b>strikethrough</b>:  A boolean (true or false) specifying
      whether or not the text should be drawn with a strike-through
      line through the middle.

      <li><b>style</b>: one of the strings "italic", "oblique", or "normal",
      specifying the style variation.  An oblique font is a normal
      font with its glyphs slanted forward slightly; in contrast,
      italics usually have a somewhat different design from the
      corresponding normal style, with different serif forms.

      <li><b>text</b>:  The text to add, using the style settings given
      by the other properties.  This can be a string, which adds the
      text it contains to the layout.  It can also be an array, in which
      case each element of the array is added, one at a time.  Or it
      can be an object containing another descriptor just like the
      main descriptor, in which case the style elements in the nested
      descriptor are combined with the style elements in the parent
      descriptor.  This is especially useful with an array of
      descriptor objects, since this lets you add several pieces of
      text with different styles all based on the parent style.

      <li><b>underline</b>: A boolean (true or false) specifying
      whether or not the text should be underlined.

      <li><b>weight</b>:  A number giving the font weight.  Font weights
      are expressed in units where 400 is normal and 700 is bold.  Those
      are the only two weights that most Windows fonts implement, although
      some professional-level fonts offer a wider weight range.  In principle,
      the Windows typography system allows for weights from 100 (which
      represents "ultra light" typefaces) to 900 ("ultra bold").

   </ul>
      
</p>

<p>
   <a name="draw"></a>
   <b><i>styledText</i>.draw(<i>drawingContext</i>, <i>layoutRect</i>, <i>clipRect</i>):</b>
   Draw the object's text (defined when it was created with <b>new</b>) into
   the <a href="CustomDrawing.html#drawingContext">drawing context</a>,
   laying it out to fit the layout area given by <i>layoutRect</i>.
   <p>
      The <i>drawingContext</i> object is the argument that the system
      passes to your custom drawing function when you use a
      <a href="DrawingLayer.html">Drawing Layer</a> or other
      <a href="CustomDrawing.html">Custom Drawing</a> mechanism.
      As a result, you can only call the StyledText <b>draw()</b> method from
      within one a drawing function, since that's the only place where
      a drawing context is valid.  (This restriction doesn't apply to
      other StyledText operations, though.  You can create a
      StyledText object at any time, and you can hold onto it
      and use it in as many different drawing operations as
      you want.  The StyledText object itself isn't tied to
      a particular window or drawing operation; it's just an
      encapsulation of the formatted text.)
   </p>
   <p>
      The layout rectangle isn't a hard limit on the bounds
      of the displayed text - the display might exceed this
      area in some cases, such as when a word that can't be
      broken across lines is too wide to fit the available space.
      The formatter tries to fit the text to the specified area,
      but the text is allowed to spill outside the bounds if
      there's no way to make it fit.
   </p>
   <p>
      The layout rectangle is also the reference frame for text alignment.
      If the object was created with center alignment, for example, the
      text will be centered within the layout rectangle.   Likewise,
      right alignment will draw the text aligned to the right side
      of the layout rectangle.
   </p>
   <p>
      If you specified any padding when creating the StyledText object,
      the padding is applied <i>inside</i> the layout rectangle.
      The results from <b>measure()</b> behave the same way, by
      including the padding in the size calculations returned.
      That means you can usually just ignore the padding and let the
      StyledText object handle it, since as far as you're concerned,
      it's just part of the text layout.
   </p>
   <p>
      <i>clipRect</i> is optional.  If it's included, the drawing will
      be "clipped" to this area, meaning that pixels outside of this
      area will simply not be drawn.  Clipping doesn't attempt to
      keep whole characters intact, since it's simply at the pixel
      level; it can result in characters being chopped in half
      vertically or horizontally if they spill outside of the
      clipping boundaries.  If <i>clipRect</i> is omitted (the
      argument is missing, or you explicitly pass <b>undefined</b>),
      the drawing isn't clipped, so it can affect pixels outside of the layout
      rectangle.  The actual display area can exceed the layout area
      for a number of reasons, such as words that are too long to fit
      the specified layout width, too many lines to fit the layout height, or fonts with
      characters that are deliberately designed to extend outside
      of their character cells (which can happen with italic or
      oblique type, and is also common with decorative fonts, where
      "swashes" and ligatures and the like are often designed to
      extend far enough to overlap adjoining characters).
   </p>
   <p>
      Both rectangles (<i>layoutRect</i> and <i>clipRect</i>) are
      specified as objects, with properties { x, y, width, height },
      giving the upper left corner of the rectangle, and its size.
      As with all Custom Drawing coordinates, the rectangle coordinates
      are all in terms of pixel positions within the Custom Drawing
      surface, starting with (0,0) at the upper left corner of the
      drawing surface.

   <a name="measure"></a>
   <b><i>styledText</i>.measure(<i>width</i>):</b>
   Measure the text contained in the StyledText object, taking into
   account all of the font styles and sizes, and fitting it to the
   given width by word-wrapping the text.  <i>width</i> is
   specified in pixels.
   <p>
      The method returns an object with the following properties:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li><b>drawingArea:</b> A rectangle, with properties { x, y, width, height },
      giving the pixel coordinates of the outer bounds of the area needed
      to draw all of the pixels of the styled text.  This takes into
      account any glyphs that extend outside of their  positioning boxes,
      so the width and height here might be slightly different from the
      main width and height properties, which specify the "layout"
      area.  The layout area only takes into account the character
      cells of the glyphs, whereas the drawing area takes into account
      all affected pixels.  Some fonts, especially decorative fonts
      and italic/oblique fonts, have glyphs that extend slightly
      outside of their character cells so that they can overlap
      adjacent characters.  The drawing area takes those overflow
      pixels into account so that you can calculate an accurate
      clipping area if needed.
      <p>
         The x and y values are relative to the layout box, so you
         can add these to the actual upper left corner of the position
         where you're going to actually draw the object.
      </p>
      
      <li><b>height:</b> A number giving the layout height
      in pixels of the text when laid out in the available space.
      This includes any top and bottom padding specified
      when the StyledText object was created.

      <li><b>width:</b>  A number giving the layout width
      in pixels of the text when laid out in the available space.
      This includes any left and right padding specified
      when the StyledText object was created.
      This might be more or less than the width you specified,
      since it measures the actual space needed to fit the glyphs.
      The text formatter tries to keep the width
      under the maximum you specify, but this might not be possible;
      for example, a single word that can't be broken across lines
      might exceed the available width.  When the text does fit
      the given maximum, the actual returned width might be less
      than the specified maximum, since there might not be any
      lines that happened to need the full available space after
      word-wrapping.
