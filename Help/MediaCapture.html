<h1>Media Capture</h1>

<p>
   PinballY can automatically create background images and videos for your
   games by capturing live screen shots of the games as they run in their
   player system.
</p>

<h2>How does PinballY determine the screen area to capture?</h2>

<p>
   During capture, PinballY captures screen images from the <b>exact same areas
   of the screen</b> where your PinballY windows are located:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The playfield image/video is captured from the screen area that
   the PinballY playfield window covers

   <li>The backglass image/video is captured from the screen area that
   the PinballY backglass window covers

   <li>Etc.
</ul>

<p>
   This means that you must arrange your PinballY windows to exactly mimic
   the screen layout that the actual running game will use.  For example,
   if the game will display the playfield in full-screen mode on monitor 1,
   make sure that the PinballY playfield window is in full-screen mode on
   the same monitor.
</p>

<p>
   Why does PinballY use its own window layout rather than the game's window
   layout?  This seems a little strange at first glance to some people:
   surely the game's layout should take precedence, shouldn't it?
   The snag is that PinballY can't be sure what the game's layout
   really is.  The game might open multiple windows, or it might show
   multiple things in a single window (e.g., it might combine the backglass
   and DMD area in a single window).  PinballY has no way to know which
   window is which or how the game subdivides its window contents.  So
   PinballY has to rely on your assistance.  We thought the easiest, most
   convenient, and most natural way to let you specify the game's window
   layout is to do it "by example", by arranging PinballY's windows to
   match.  If you're running on a pin cab, that's almost certainly
   how you've arranged things anyway: you probably have it set up
   so that PinballY and all of your games have exactly the same layout,
   since each monitor has a specific purpose in a pin cab.
   If you're running on a desktop system, though, you might not be using
   the exact same layout for everything, so you might have to tweak you
   window layout to get the right capture areas.
</p>
   

<h2>Capture timing</h2>

<p>
   The capture process relies a lot on timing.  The
   <a href="CaptureOptions.html">Capture Options</a> section in the settings
   dialog lets you adjust many of the timing parameters as needed, so if
   the capture is starting too quickly (before the game has finished
   initializing), for example, or you want longer or shorter videos,
   you can adjust the settings there.
</p>
<p>
   One of the key timing parameters is the startup time for the game.
   The capture process takes an image of what's actually on the display,
   so you obviously want it to wait until the game is fully initialized
   before taking any screen shots.  PinballY can't tell when the game
   is actually ready for capture, so it uses a simple time delay to
   give the game a chance to get started.  If some games take too
   long, and you're getting screen shots of their loading screens,
   you can adjust the setting "Wait for game to start" in the capture
   options.
</p>
<p>
   As an alternative to relying on timing, you can tell PinballY
   that you want to control parts of the capture process manually.
   You can do this using the "Manual start" and "Manual stop"
   settings for the individual media types in the capture options.
   When manual start or stop is in effect, the PinballY capture
   status window will show a prompt telling you to press both
   flipper buttons to advance to the next step.
</p>


<h2>Initiating a capture</h2>

<p>
   There are two ways to initiate the capture process: one game at a time, or
   "batch capture", which captures screen shots for a whole group of games in
   a single operation.
</p>

<h3>Single game capture</h2>

<p>
   To capture media for one game at a time:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Navigate to the game in the wheel UI
   
   <li>Open the <a href="OperatorMenu.html">Operator Menu</a> by pressing the "0" (digit zero) key
   (or whichever key you assigned if you changed it in the options)

   <li>Select "Game Setup" to open the <a href="GameSetupMenu.html">Game Setup menu</a>

   <li>Select "Capture images &amp; videos"

   <li>Follow the menu prompts to select the types of media you'd like to capture for the game,
   then select "Begin Capture"
</ul>

<p>
   <b>Selecting media types to capture:</b>  Before the capture starts, the program
   shows a menu asking you to select which types of media to capture.  If the game
   already has an existing file for a given type (e.g., the backglass video), the
   menu will let you select whether to keep the existing item or replace it.
</p>

<h3>Batch capture</h2>

<p>
   Batch capture lets you capture media for multiple games in a single operation.
   PinballY will automatically step through the games you select, launching each
   game, capturing the desired media, exiting the game, and moving on to the next
   selected game.
</p>
<p>
   To start a batch capture operation:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Open the <a href="OperatorMenu.html">Operator Menu</a> by pressing the "0" (digit zero) key
   (or whichever key you assigned if you changed it in the options)

   <li>Select "Batch Capture" from the menu
</ul>

<p>
   The batch capture operation will lead you through a series of menus to let you
   specify which games and which types of media to include in the capture.  Before
   the capture operation actually starts, the program will give you a chance to
   review the exact list of titles and media items that will be included in the
   capture.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Selecting which games to capture:</b>  The first step of the batch capture
   setup menus lets you select which games to capture.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The first option is "All Games".  Select this to include all of your
   configured games in the capture.

   <li>If you currently have a filter selected in the wheel UI (e.g.,
   "Filter by manufacturer" or "Filter by year"), you'll see a second option
   in the menu to include just the tables selected by the filter.  This option
   will only be present if a filter is in effect.  If you want to use
   a different filter, cancel out of the capture menu, select the desired
   filter in the wheel UI, and start the batch capture command again.

   <li>The last option is "Games marked for batch capture".  This includes
   only the games that you've manually marked for capture, which lets you
   construct an ad hoc set of games to capture as a group.  To mark a game
   for capture, navigate to the game in the wheel UI, open the
   <a href="GameSetupMenu.html">Game Setup menu</a>, and select
   "Mark for batch capture" from the menu.  The menu command will be shown
   with a checkmark if you've already marked the game for capture.
   <p>
      The "marked for capture" flag is automatically removed from a game
      after a successful capture is performed on the game, so you don't
      have to worry about clearing these flags yourself.  You can remove
      the flag manually at any time, though, simply by un-checking the
      item in the menu.
   </p>
</ul>

<p>
   Note that whichever subset of games you choose, the batch can only
   include <b>configured</b> games - that is, games with database entries.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Selecting which media types to capture:</b>  As with the regular
   one-game-at-a-time capture, the program shows a menu that lets you select
   which media types to capture during the batch operation.  This is a
   two-step process for batch capture:  first you select which types you
   want to include in the capture at all, and then you select what you
   want to do with any existing files (keep them or replace them).
</p>

<p>
   <b>Reviewing the capture list:</b>  Before the batch process starts,
   the program gives you a chance to review the list of items to be
   captured.  This will show each game to include in the batch, and
   the disposition (capture new, keep, replace) for each media type
   for each game.  This gives you a chance to cancel the capture if
   the games to be included don't line up with what you expected.
</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting tips</h2>

<p>
   If you run a capture, and the resulting playfield video or image shows
   a gray or black background with the text "Capturing Media", or shows the
   capture status box, you might need to increase the startup delay time.
   FFMPEG might have started recording the screen image before the game
   actually started, making it capture PinballY loading screens instead of
   the game. You might need a longer startup delay, which you can configure
   in the Media Capture options.
</p>
<p>
   Another possibility is that the game is running in "Exclusive Full-Screen"
   mode. Visual Pinball and some other systems offer this option, which sends
   graphics directly to the video card, bypassing Windows. FFMPEG captures from
   the Windows display drivers, so it can't capture games running in Exclusive
   mode. If possible, change the game options to use "Windowed Full-Screen"
   mode. (That's an option you have to set in the game player program itself,
   not PinballY.)
