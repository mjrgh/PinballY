<h1>DrawingLayer Objects</h1>

<p>
   PinballY lets you add your own custom graphics to any of its windows
   from Javascript using "drawing layers".  A drawing layer is a virtual
   image, stored in memory, where you can load a video or image file, or
   draw your own complex graphics using the <a href="CustomDrawing.html">Custom
   Drawing</a> facility.
</p>
<p>
   We use the term "layer" because PinballY thinks about its graphics as
   a set of transparencies stacked one on top of the next.  What you actually
   see on the screen is the result of combining all of the layers making
   up a window.  In the main window, for example, the system's standard
   graphics include a background layer that displays a video or image of
   the current game's playfield, a separate layer that displays the wheel
   icons, another layer with the status text messages, and so on.  
</p>

<h2>Event target</h2>

<p>
   DrawingLayer objects are event targets for certain events, so you can use the
   standard event methods (on(), off(), addEventListener(), etc) to add and remove
   event listeners.  See <a href="EventTarget.html">EventTarget</a>.
</p>
<p>
   DrawingTarget objects serve as the event target for the following event types:
</p>
<div class="eventTargetTOC" data-eventtarget="DrawingLayer"></div>

<h2>How to create a drawing layer</h2>
<p>
   You create a custom drawing layer in a given window by calling the
   <a href="WindowObjects.html#createDrawingLayer">createDrawingLayer()</a>
   method on the window object.  For example, this creates a new drawing
   layer in the DMD window:
</p>
<div class="code">
let overlay = dmdWindow.createDrawingLayer(1000);
</div>
<p>
   The argument specifies the desired Z index for the layer.  See below
   for more on what the Z index means.
</p>
<p>
   The return value from the method is a DrawingLayer object, which you
   can use to load image files or video files into the layer, or to draw
   more complex graphics using the <a href="CustomDrawing.html">Custom Drawing</a>
   facility.  The DrawingLayer object returned provides methods and properties,
   listed below, that let you control what it displays.
</p>

<h2>Removing a layer</h2>
<p>
   When you're done with a layer, you can remove it by calling the
   <a href="WindowObjects.html#createDrawingLayer">removeDrawingLayer()</a>
   method on the same window object that you used to create the layer.
</p>
<div class="code">
dmdWindow.removeDrawingLayer(overlay);
</div>
<p>
   Removing a layer removes its on-screen graphics and makes the Javascript
   object representing the layer invalid.  Any attempts to load media into
   the layer or draw graphics into it will simply be ignored.
</p>

<h2>Temporarily hiding a layer</h2>
<p>
   In some cases, you might want to create a layer that comes and goes,
   according to what's going on in the user interface.  One way to
   do this is to create and remove the layer as needed.  However, if
   the layer will be re-activated frequently, it's more efficient to
   keep the layer object around and simply remove its on-screen graphics.
   An easy and efficient way to do this is to set the layer to display
   an image that's completely transparent, which you can do with
   the <b>clear()</b> method:
</p>
<div class="code">
overlay.clear(0x00000000);
</div>
<p>
   This simply fills the whole layer with a fixed color with a zero
   "alpha" value.  Zero alpha means complete transparency, so the
   layer will be invisible on-screen.
</p>
  
<h2>Z index</h2>
<p>
   The order of the layers is important, because it determines which
   graphics are drawn in front of (and therefore block or occlude) other
   graphics.  The order is deterministic, and entirely under your
   control, because it's determined by the "Z index" of each layer.
   You specify the desired Z index when you create a layer.  The Z
   index is just an arbitrary integer value that's up to you to define,
   but the important thing about it is that layers with higher Z
   index values are drawn in front of layers with lower Z index
   values.
</p>
<p>
   For most of the windows, all of your custom layers are drawn in
   front of the background image/video layer that the system uses
   to draw the selected game's media for that window.  The only
   thing you have to worry about with the Z index in those windows
   is how it relates to other custom layers you've created, since
   all of your layers will be in front of the system's background
   graphics.
</p>
<p>
   The exception is the main window, where the system uses numerous
   layers of its own to display the components of the standard UI.
   In the main window, you can control where your added custom
   layers go relative to the system layers.  For example, you could place a custom
   layer immediately in front of or immediately behind the status
   line text.  The order of layers for the main window
   is listed in <a href="MainWindowObject.html#drawingLayers">Drawing
   layer ordering</a> in the <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow
   object</a> section.
</p>
   
<h2>Sizing and scaling</h2>

<p>
   By default, the graphics in a custom drawing layer are stretched
   to exactly fill the entire window, in both width and height.
   If the user resizes the window, the system stretches the
   graphics to match the new window size.  This is just the
   default, though; you can change it so that the image only
   occupies a portion of the window, and you can also make the
   image preserve a fixed aspect ratio, rather than distorting
   the geometry to fit the window size.
</p>

<p>
   If you're familiar with basic Windows graphics programming, you
   probably think of the size of an image or text display in terms
   of pixels.  PinballY takes a different, more abstract approach,
   based on scaling everything relative to the window size.  This
   will be a little strange if you're used to working in terms of raw
   pixels, but it simplifies things by letting the system take care
   of resizing everything to maintain a constant scale when the
   window layout changes.
</p>
<p>
   There are two key concepts to PinballY's approach to sizing.
   The first is the "aspect ratio" of the original graphics loaded
   into a layer.  This is simply the ratio of the width to the
   height of the original image or video loaded into the layer.
   The second is the "span" of the layer, which is the fraction
   of the window's width or height that the layer occupies.
   A span of 1.0 means that the layer is stretched to exactly
   fill the window's width or height; a span of 0.5 means that
   it's scaled to 1/2 of the window's size.
</p>
<p>
   The original aspect ratio is determined in terms of traditional
   pixel sizes.  When you load an image or video from a file, the
   aspect ratio is determined based on the native size of the image
   stored in the file.  For example, if you load a PNG file with a
   pixel size of 640 pixels wide by 480 pixels tall, it has an
   aspect ratio of 640/480 or 1.333.  
</p>
<p>
   The "span" is something you can control for each layer, using the
   the <a href="#setScale">setScale()</a> method on the layer.
   You pass this method an object with properties that specify
   the constraints on how the layer is sized.
   There are several ways to set the span, with different results
   when the window is resized:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><span class="code">layer.setScale({xSpan: 1.0, ySpan: 1.0}):</span>
   This sets <i>both</i> the X and Y spans.  This stretches the layer's
   image/video in both the width and height dimensions to exactly fill
   the specified fraction of the window.  The original aspect ratio
   of the contents is ignored, since you're telling the system that
   you want the width and height pegged to the window's size.  In
   this case, the graphics will be stretched to exactly fill the
   entire window in both dimensions.  You could make it fill a portion
   of the window by using a number between 0 and 1; for example, 0.5
   would make it fill exactly half the width and half the height.

   <li><span class="code">layer.setScale({xSpan: 1.0}):</span>  This
   sets <i>only</i> the X span, leaving the Y span as a "free" dimension.
   When X is constrained like this and Y is free, it means that the image
   will be sized to satisfy the X (width) constraint, and the Y (height)
   will be adjusted so that it maintains the original aspect ratio of
   the contents, regardless of whether that makes the image too tall
   or too short for the window.  This ensures that the image will be
   displayed without geometric distortion, since its original width-to-height
   proportions are maintained.  As always, 1.0 means that the span exactly
   fills the window - in this case, the image will be stretched to a
   width that exactly fills the window's width.

   <li><span class="code">layer.setScale({ySpan: 1.0}):</span>  This
   sets <i>only</i> the Y span.  This is just like setting the X span
   only, but in this case it pegs the layer's height to the window's
   height, setting the width so that the original image's aspect ratio
   is maintained.

   <li><span class="code">layer.setScale({span: 1.0}):</span>  This
   sets the "combined" span.  This means that <i>either</i> the width
   <i>or</i> height will be sized to fill the specified fraction of
   the window.  But which one?  The one that makes the image fit the
   window without making the <i>other</i> dimension too wide or tall
   to fit the window.  This is the most flexible option, since it
   makes sure that the full contents of the layer fit the window,
   while maintaining the aspect ratio, even if the window is unusually
   tall or wide.
</ul>

<h3>How scaling interacts with custom drawing</h3>

<p>
   Things get weird when we start talking about custom drawing, because
   now we have to start thinking in terms of pixels in addition to
   the constraint-based scaling.  The custom drawing system is based
   on plain old pixels, like PNG files or conventional Windows
   graphics programming.  How do we reconcile the pixel-based drawing
   with the span-based scaling?
</p>
<p>
   It's actually not that difficult if you think about the right way.
   Think about the custom drawing system as working on a "canvas" -
   basically a virtual PNG file that you're creating on the fly in
   memory.  Like a PNG file, the canvas has a width and height in
   pixels.  You can plop text onto the canvas at any pixel position,
   and you can draw graphics primitives and copy other images into
   pixel areas on the canvas.
</p>
<p>
   Whatever you do with the canvas, when you're done, you have a
   rectangular image that's X pixels by Y pixels in size.  This is just
   like a PNG file that's X pixels by Y pixels in size, except that
   it only exists in memory, not as a disk file.  We now load
   this X-by-Y-pixel image into a drawing layer.  It's only at
   this point that the more abstract window-based scaling kicks in.  PinballY
   now takes that X-by-Y-pixel image and stretches it to fill
   the desired fraction of the window's width and height, according
   to the "span" values in your drawing layer's scale settings.  Whenever
   the window size or layout changes, PinballY rescales the image,
   going back to the same X-by-Y-pixel original, and stretching it
   to match the new window layout.
</p>
<p>
   This dual sizing scheme - pixel sizing for the underlying image, window
   percentages for the final display - gives you a lot of flexibility.
   A really nice feature is that it lets you create custom drawings at a fixed pixel size, without
   having to worry about how large or small the image will be when actually
   displayed.  That lets you arrange the drawing with the exact proportions
   you want, based on pre-determined sizes for the elements within the
   drawing, such as text and external images you draw onto the canvas.
   The finished image will then be displayed at whatever size is needed
   in the UI, thanks to the window-based scaling.
</p>
   

<h2>Methods and properties</h2>

<a name="alpha"></a>
<p>
   <b><i>layer</i>.alpha:</b>  Gets or sets the layer's alpha transparency
   value.  This must be a value from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully
   opaque).  Values between 0 and 1 represent partial transparency; 0.25
   represents 25% opacity, for example.  This controls the transparency of
   the whole layer; it's combined
   with the transparency of each individual pixel.  You can use this to
   perform effects such as fading the layer in or out.
</p>

<a name="clear"></a>
<p>
   <b><i>layer</i>.clear(<i>argb</i>):</b>  Clears any video or graphics
   displayed in the layer, and fills the entire layer with the given background
   color.  This is specified as a hex value in the format 0xAARRGGBB, where
   AA is the alpha value, RR is the red component, GG is the green component,
   and BB is the blue component.  Each component ranges from 00 to FF.
   An alpha value of 00 means fully transparent, and FF means fully opaque.
   Here are some examples of how you can use this:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>#FF404040 creates a dark gray, completely opaque background that
   completely hides anything in a lower layer

   <li>#00000000 creates a completely transparent layer, making the layer
   effectively invisible (hiding it while it's not being used, for example)

   <li>#40FF0000 creates a red layer that's 25% opaque, adding a red tint
   to the layers behind it
</ul>
<p>
   You can alternatively specify the color as a string in HTML "#RGB"
   or "#RRGGBB" format.  With these string formats, the alpha is implicitly
   FF for fully opaque.  You can also simply specify the name of a
   configuration variable in the settings file, in which case it'll
   be parsed as an HTML color value, and the result used as the color.
</p>

<a name="draw"></a>
<p>
   <b><i>layer</i>.draw(<i>func</i>, <i>width</i>, <i>height</i>):</b>
   Clears any prior video or graphics displayed in the launch overlay, and calls
   the provided function to perform custom drawing.  The function is called with
   a "drawing context" object as its parameter.  See
   <a href="CustomDrawing.html">Custom Drawing</a> for details on how this works.
</p>
<p>
   Your custom graphics are drawn into an in-memory image with the
   given width and height in pixels.  If you don't specify these arguments,
   the window's current size in pixels is used by default.  Remember that
   the pixel size doesn't determine the actual <b>display</b> size of the graphics.
   The actual display size is determined by the scaling settings made via
   <a href="#setScale">setScale()</a>.  The pixel sizing is important, however,
   because it specifies the size of the "canvas" that you're working with
   when laying out text and other graphics in your custom drawing function.
   All of those low-level drawing operations work in terms of pixels.
   The finished result will be automatically scaled up or down to match the
   current window size, according to the scaling settings you specify
   in setScale().
</p>

<a name="drawDMDText"></a>
<p>
   <b><i>layer</i>.drawDMDText(<i>text</i>, <i>options</i>):</b>
   Draws a DMD-style text screen.  This generates a still image that looks
   like a score-area text display, and then loads the image into the drawing
   layer.  (Even though this uses the DMD display style, you can use it in
   any window to create a DMD-like text effect in that window.)
   This is effectively an image-loader function, so like the other
   media loader functions (loadImage(), loadVideo(), etc), it replaces any
   previous image that the layer was displaying.
</p>
<p>
   <i>text</i> is the text to display.  This can contain multiple lines, by
   using "\n" (newline) characters to separate the lines.  <i>options</i> is
   an object with more information on exactly how to generate the simulated
   DMD image.  If you omit the object entirely, or provide the object but
   omit any of the individual properties listed below, the system chooses
   suitable defaults based on the currently selected game.  The option
   properties are:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>bgColor:</b> The background color, for the DMD and alphanumeric
   styles.  This is the color used to fill the empty space between the
   DMD dots or alphanumeric display segments.  This can
   be specified as a hex number, in 0xAARRGGBB format (AA is the alpha
   transparency component), or as an HTML "#RRGGBB" or "#AARRGGBB" string.
   Setting the alpha to something less than FF will make the background
   partially transparent, so that the generated image can be superimposed
   over another background drawing layer. Setting the alpha to 00 will make
   the generated image's background entirely transparent, so that only
   the dots or alphanumeric segments occlude background material.  This
   is ignored for the "tt" style, which uses a background image instead.

   <li><b>color:</b> This is the color of the dots making up the dot matrix
   for the "dmd" style, or the colors of the segments for the 16-segment
   display in the "alpha" style.  It's ignored for the "tt" style.
   The color can be specified as a hex number, in 0xRRGGBB format, or as an
   HTML "#RRGGBB" string.  This color is always fully opaque; any alpha
   component you specify is ignored.
   <p>
      If the color isn't specified, and the game has a VPinMAME ROM
      associated with it, the color is taken from the VPinMAME settings
      for the game.  (A particular game's VPinMAME settings can be
      accessed when you're running the game with Visual Pinball, or by
      running VPinMAME directly and loading the game.)  If the game has
      a VPinMAME ROM, but you've never selected custom colors for the
      game through VPinMAME, the default VPinMAME DMD color settings
      are used.  If the game doesn't have a VPinMAME ROM at all, a
      default amber color scheme is used, approximating the color of the
      monochrome plasma displays originally used in most 1990s
      pinball machines.
   </p>

   <li><b>font:</b> The font to use for the text.  The interpretation of
   the font name depends on the drawing style.
   <ul>
      <li>For the "dmd" style, the drawing system uses special built-in
      fonts designed specifically for the dot matrix layout.  These are
      named according to the pixel height of the character cell:
      <ul class="compact">
         <li>"dmd-20px"
         <li>"dmd-15px"
         <li>"dmd-12px"
         <li>"dmd-9px"
         <li>"dmd-7px"
         <li>"dmd-5px"
      </ul>
      <p>
         If you don't specify one of these dmd-NNpx fonts, the system
         will automatically choose the largest one that will make your
         text message fit the display.  If you're displaying a series
         of messages in succession, you might want to specify one font
         across the whole sequence to make the messages look more
         consistent.  The fonts use proportional spacing (different
         widths per character), so there's no exact formula for how
         much text will fit on the 128x32-dot display, but roughly
         speaking, the "12px" font will fit two lines of text of about
         10-12 characters per line, and "9px" will fit three lines
         of about 16 characters per line.
      </p>

      <li>For the "alpha" drawing style, the drawing system uses special
      built-in fonts designed specifically for the segmented display.
      The following fonts are available:
      <ul class="compact">
         <li>"alphanum-thin" (thinner segments; this is the default)
         <li>"alphanum-bold" (wider segments)
      </ul>

      <li>For the "tt" drawing style, the text is displayed using normal
      Windows TrueType fonts, so you can specify any TrueType font here.
      The default is Courier New, which has a typewritten appearance,
      to create the impression of an ad hoc note attached to the machine.
   </ul>
   <p>
      You can specify more than one font by separating the font names with
      commas.  For example, "Lucida Sans, Courier New, dmd-12px".  The
      drawing system will try to match each font in the order provided,
      considering only the font names valid for the selected style and
      available on the system, until it finds a match.  (Any additional
      fonts listed after the first match are ignored.)  This has two uses:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>The first is to provide fallback fonts for
      the "tt" style, in case your first choice of fonts isn't installed
      on the system.  For example, you could specify something
      like "Letter Gothic, Lucia Typewriter, Courier New".
      
      <li>The second use is to provide font selections for each possible
      drawing style when you're letting the system choose by setting
      <b>style</b> to "auto" (or simply omitting it).  You might still
      want to control the font in this case, but since you don't know
      which style you'll get, you can't know whether "dmd-12px",
      "alphanum-bold", or "Lucida Typewriter" applies.  The solution is
      to specify them all, or at least to specify the ones that you
      want to override.  If the system chooses the DMD style, it
      will ignore any fonts that aren't in the special "dmd-Npx" set,
      so it's safe to include "Lucida Typewriter" and "alphanum-bold"
      in the list.  By the same token, if the system uses the alphanumeric
      style, it'll ignore any fonts other than the "alphanum-xxx" fonts.
      And if the "tt" style is used, the system will naturally ignore
      the "dmd-Npx" and "alphanum-xxx" fonts, since those aren't the
      names of any TrueType Windows fonts.  (Technically, they <i>could</i>
      be the names of TrueType fonts, but in practice they probably won't
      be.  To reduce the chances of accidentally picking a TrueType
      font with such an odd name, you might want to list the "tt"
      font options first, so that a proper TrueType font will be
      selected for the "tt" style before the drawing system even
      considers the others.)
   </ul>
      
   <li><b>style:</b>  A string specifying the display style; one of "auto",
   "dmd", "alpha", or "tt".  This is the same style selection you can make
   for a game's high score display in the normal UI, via the
   <a href="EditGameDetails.html">Edit Game Details</a> dialog.  If you
   omit this or specify "auto", the high-score display style for the
   current game will be used, as set in the game's metadata or as
   inferred from the game's table type and era.  For example, games
   from the early 1980s use the "alpha" style by default, and games
   from the 1990s use the "dmd" style.
</ul>

<a name="loadImage"></a>
<p>
   <b><i>layer</i>.loadImage(<i>filename</i>):</b>  Loads the given image file and displays
   it in the launch overlay layer.  The filename must be a fully qualified Windows
   path, with drive, directory, and extension.  The normal collection of image
   file formats can be used (JPEG, PNG).  The image is stretched to fill
   the window.  You can use the <b>draw()</b> method if you need more control
   over the image layout, or if you want to use multiple images or mix images
   with text or other graphics.  The new image replaces any prior video that
   was playing, any prior image, or any custom graphics displayed via <b>draw()</b>.
</p>

<a name="loadVideo"></a>
<p>
   <b><i>layer</i>.loadVideo(<i>filename</i>, <i>options</i>):</b>
   Loads and plays the given video in the
   launch overlay layer.  The filename must be a fully qualified path, with drive,
   directory, and extension.  The usual video formats are supported (MP4, MPG, etc).
   The video is stretched to fill the window.  If any prior video was playing or
   any prior graphics were displayed, this removes the existing video or graphics.
</p>
<p>
   <i>options</i> is an object specifying playback options.  If this is omitted,
   defaults are used for all options; if the object is specified, the defaults
   are used for any missing properties.  The properties are:
</p>
<ul class="compact">
   <li><b>loop:</b> boolean, default true, specifying whether the video plays
   once or plays continuously in a loop
   <li><b>mute:</b> boolean, default false, specifying if the video is played
   back with sound muted
   <li><b>play:</b> boolean, default true, specifying if the video should start
   playing immediately after loading; if false, the video will be paused at its
   first frame
   <li><b>volume:</b> integer from 0 to 100, default 100, specifying the audio
   volume (ignored if the video is muted)
</ul>
<p>
   Animated GIF files are a special case for this method, because PinballY
   technically treats them as images rather than videos (which it has to
   do because libvlc, the codec layer that we use for other videos, doesn't
   work properly with GIF animation).  Because PinballY treats all GIFs as images,
   even animated ones, you can load an animated GIF through the <b>loadImage()</b>
   method.  But you can also use this method, since it has special handling
   to detect GIFs and load them as images.  So GIFs will load properly with
   either method.  But there is one situation where you might want to use this
   method explicitly:  if you want to specify the <b>play</b> or <b>loop</b>
   options, you can do that with this method, but not with loadImage().
   (The volume and mute options are ignored, though, since GIFs inherently
   can't have audio tracks.)
</p>

<a name="mute"></a>
<p>
   <b>mute:</b>  This is a read/write boolean property that gets or sets the
   current muting status for video playback in the layer.  True means that the
   video's audio track is muted.  If no video is loaded, this always reads as
   false, and setting it to a new value has no effect.  Animated GIFs don't
   have audio tracks, so they have the same behavior as if no video is loaded.
</p>

<a name="pause"></a>
<p>
   <b><i>layer</i>.pause():</b>  If a video or animated GIF is playing, pauses
   playback at the current frame.  This has no effect for a still image (including
   custom-drawn graphics and background color fill).
</p>

<a name="play"></a>
<p>
   <b><i>layer</i>.play():</b>  If a video or animated GIF is loaded, and
   playback is paused, this resumes playback.  This has no effect for a still image.
</p>

<a name="setPos"></a>
<p>
   <b><i>layer</i>.setPos(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>align</i>):</b>  Sets the layer's position
   in the window.  <i>align</i> determines the alignment reference point.  This
   is a string containing a combination of "top", "middle", or "bottom" and
   "left", "center", or "right".  For example, "top right" sets the alignment
   point to the top right of the window.  If the whole string is omitted, or
   either the top/middle/bottom or left/center/right parts are missing, center
   alignment is the default.
</p>
<p>
   In all cases, the alignment specifies the <i>starting point</i> for the
   image.  Once the image has been set to that starting point, it's then
   moved by the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> distances from that point.
<ul class="compact">
   <li><b>top</b> aligns the top of the image with the top of the window
   <li><b>middle</b> vertically centers the image
   <li><b>bottom</b> aligns the bottom of the image with the bottom of the window
   <li><b>left</b> aligns the left side of the image with the left edge of the window
   <li><b>center</b> horizontally centers the image
   <li><b>right</b> aligns the right side of the image with the right edge of the window
</ul>
<p>
   Once the initial position is determined from the alignment, the image is
   then moved from that point by the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> values.  These
   are both on scales from -0.5 to +0.5, representing the edges of the window
   in that dimension, with 0.0 representing the center of the window.
</p>
<p>
   This coordinate system is probably a bit different from what you're used
   to if you've done any pixel-oriented programming.  One big difference
   is that the "zero" point on both axes is the <i>center</i> of the window,
   not the upper left corner.  Another is that the vertical axis is
   positive in the <i>upwards</i> direction.  Most graphics programming
   has the Y axis upside-down, so that row 0 is at the top and increasing
   Y values represent positions further down on the screen.  The way to
   keep this new coordinate system straight is to think about it like a
   mathematical graph layout - picture doing a plot of a parabola in an
   algebra class, say.
</p>
<p>
   As with the sizing and scaling system, the coordinates for the position
   system are relative to the window size.  This might seem confusing at
   first, but like the scaling system, this makes the layout pretty much
   automatic once you get the hang of it.  For example, X position 0.25
   is always halfway between the center of the window and the right edge,
   no matter what size the window is.  That makes it fairly easy to keep
   an image aligned with a reference point, regardless of the current
   window size.
</p>

<a name="setScale"></a>
<p>
   <b><i>layer</i>.setScale(<i>options</i>):</b>  Sets the scaling rules for
   the layer, which determine how the layer's graphics are sized relative to
   the window.  Whenever the window is resized, the layer is resized according
   to the scale rules, so that the graphics are always sized proportionally to
   the window.  <i>options</i> is an object with any combination of
   the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>span:</b>  Sets the combined width and height span for the layer.
   This is only used if both xSpan and ySpan are omitted.  The system sizes
   the layer so that it maintains the original aspect ratio of the loaded
   image, video, or custom drawing, and so that it fills the specified
   fraction in <i>either</i> the width or height, such that the other
   dimension also fits within the window.  If <b>span</b> is 1.0, it
   means that the layer will be sized to exactly fill the full width of
   the window <i>or</i> the full height of the window, choosing the one
   so that the other dimension also fits the window when the original
   aspect ratio is maintained.  0.75 means that one of the dimensions
   will fill 75% of the width or height.

   <li><b>xSpan:</b>  Sets the width span, so that the layer's width
   exactly fills the given fraction of the window's width.  1.0 means
   that the layer will exactly fill the window width.

   <li><b>ySpan:</b>  Sets the height span, so that the layer's height
   exactly fills the given fraction of the window's height.  1.0 means
   that the layer exactly fills the window height.
</ul>
<p>
   There are several possibilities for how to combine these constraints,
   described in "Sizing and scaling" above.
</p>
<p>
   The scale can be set before or after loading media or drawing custom
   graphics.  When loading media or drawing, the scale settings currently
   in effect are applied, but you can change to different scaling rules later
   while keeping the current contents.
</p>

<a name="volume"></a>
<p>
   <b>volume:</b>  This is a read/write integer property that gets or sets the
   current volume level for video playback in the layer, from 0 (silent) to 100
   (full volume).  If no video is loaded, this always reads as 100, and setting
   it to a new value has no effect.  Animated GIFs don't have audio tracks,
   so they have the same behavior as if no video is loaded.
