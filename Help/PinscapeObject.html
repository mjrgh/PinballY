<h1>pinscape Object</h1>

<p>
   <b>pinscape</b> is a pre-defined PinballY object that provides access
   to Pinscape Controller functions.  The object represents the overall
   Pinscape software interface, covering any number of controller units
   installed on the system, rather than being tied to a particular unit.
</p>

<h2>Event target</h2>

<p>
   <b>pinscape</b> is an event target,  so you can use the standard
   event methods (on(), off(), addEventListener(), etc) to add and remove
   event listeners.  See <a href="EventTarget.html">EventTarget</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The object doesn't currently define any events, but it might in the future.
</p>

<h2>Methods and properties</h2>

<p>
   The <b>pinscape</b> defines the following methods and properties.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="nightMode"></a>
   <b>pinscape.nightMode:</b>  This property lets you determine the
   current Night Mode status on the Pinscape Controller device(s), and
   lets you change the status.
</p>
<p>
   When read, the property returns <tt>true</tt>
   if any Pinscape units are currently in Night Mode, false if there are
   no controllers attached, or if none of them are in night mode.  Note
   that the property reads as <tt>true</tt> if <i>any</i> controllers are
   in Night Mode, even if there are multiple controller present and they're
   not <i>all</i> in Night Mode.  In most cases, the mode is turned on or
   off across all controllers, so it's unusual for the status to be mixed
   in practice, but if it is, the result is always <tt>true</tt> if even
   one unit has Night Mode enabled.
</p>
<p>
   When written, the property sets Night Mode status on all attached
   controllers to the new value.  Set the property to <tt>true</tt> to
   activate Night Mode on all controllers, and set it to <tt>false</tt>
   to return all controllers to normal "day mode" status.
</p>
