<h1>MediaCaptureEvent</h1>

<p>
   This event type is fired during media capture operations.  It notifies
   Javascript that a media capture is in progress, and gives the script
   a chance to modify the FFMPEG command line parameters.
</p>
<p>
   The <a href="EventTarget.html">event target</a> for this event type is the
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html">mainWindow</a> object.
</p>
<p>
   The MediaCaptureEvent class has only one subtype:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>precapture:</b> Fires just before an FFMPEG command is launched
</ul>

<p>
   The <b>precapture</b> event has access to the FFMPEG command line that's
   about to be executed, and can modify the command as needed.  The event can
   also cancel the capture entirely for the current item by calling
   preventDefault() on the event object, and it can cancel the entire
   remainder of the current batch by setting the event object
   property <b>cancelBatch</b> to true:
</p>
<div class="code">
mainWindow.on("precapture", ev => {
    ev.cancelBatch = true;
});
</div>


<h2>Properties</h2>

<ul>
   <li><b>cancelBatch:</b> A boolean, initially set to false.  If the event
   handler sets this to true before returning, PinballY will cancel the entire
   batch capture operation, including the current item and any remaining items
   in the batch.  (You can't go backwards in time and cancel prior items that
   were already completed, however.)
   
   <li><b>captureTime:</b> A number giving the duration, in milliseconds,
   of the capture.  This is the desired amount of time for the finished
   video or audio track, so it's the amount of real time that the capture
   must run.  The actual time of the operation might be longer due to
   overhead or deferred work within FFMPEG.
   
   <li><b>commandLine:</b> A string containing the full FFMPEG command line
   that's about to be executed, including the FFMPEG executable itself as
   the first element.  If the event handler assigns a new string, the new
   command will be executed instead of the original.  This allows the event
   handler to customize the command as desired.

   <li><b>dxgiOutputIndex:</b>  A number giving the DXGI index of the monitor
   containing the upper left corner of the capture area.  This is an arbitrary
   number that Windows assigns to each monitor internally, to identify the
   monitor's screen buffer within DXGI (one of the strata of graphics processing
   within Windows).  The DXGI index is needed when using the "ddagrab"
   capture mode.

   <li><b>enableAudio:</b> A boolean indicating whether or not audio is
   enabled for this capture.  This is true when capturing a video with audio
   or a standalone audio track.

   <li><b>filename:</b> A string containing the output file for the capture,
   with the full path.

   <li><b>game:</b> A <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object describing
   the game that's the subject of the current capture operation.

   <li><b>isCapturePass:</b> A boolean indicating whether or not this is the
   capture pass (true) or encoding pass (false) of a two-pass capture.  During
   a one-pass capture (i.e., if two-pass capture isn't enabled in the options),
   this is always set to true true, since the capture and encoding are both
   done during the single pass.

   <li><b>mediaType:</b> A string giving the <a href="MediaTypes.html">Media Type</a>
   of the material being captured.  This is the ID string for the media type,
   such as <tt>"table video"</tt> for a playfield video.

   <li><b>mirrorHorz:</b> A boolean, true if the captured video is to be mirrored
   horizontally.

   <li><b>mirrorVert:</b> A boolean, true if the captured video is to be mirrored
   vertically.

   <li><b>rc:</b> A rectangle object, with properties {left, top, right, bottom},
   all numbers, giving the "desktop coordinates" of the area to be captured.
   Desktop coordinates are pixel locations relative to the imaginary rectangle
   formed by the outside boundaries of all of your monitors across the whole
   Windows desktop.  These coordinates are useful when using the "gdigrab"
   capture mode in ffmpeg, since that mode takes its screen area specifications
   in terms of desktop coordinates.

   <li><b>rcMonitor:</b> A rectangle object, with properties {left, top, right, bottom},
   all numbers, giving the coordinates of the area to be captured within the monitor
   that contains its upper left corner.  These coordinates are needed when capturing
   with "ddagrab" mode.  Note that the bottom right corner in this rectangle is
   always constrained to be within the same monitor as the upper left corner, so
   if the window actually spans two monitors, rcMonitor is clipped to stay within
   the one monitor containing the upper left corner.  This is necessary for "ddagrab"
   mode, since it can only capture from within a single monitor's video buffer,
   and fails with an error if given a rectangle that goes outside of the monitor's
   bounds.

   <li><b>rotation:</b> A number giving the amount of rotation to be applied
   to the video capture, in degrees; this is one of 0, 90, 180, or 270.


</ul>
