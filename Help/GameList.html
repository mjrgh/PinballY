<h1>gameList Object</h1>

<p>
   The gameList object represents the program's internal database of
   games.  Methods on this object provide Javascript access to the
   list of loaded games and their details.
</p>

<h2>Event target</h2>

<p>
   gameList is an event target object, so you can use the standard
   event methods (on(), off(), addEventListener(), etc) to add and remove
   event listeners.  See <a href="EventTarget.html">EventTarget</a>.
</p>
<p>
   gameList serves as the event target for the following event types:
</p>
<div class="eventTargetTOC" data-eventtarget="gameList"></div>

<h2>Properties and methods</h2>

<p>
    The gameList object has the following properties and methods:
</p>

<p>
   <a name="createCategory"></a>
   <b>gameList.createCategory(<i>name</i>):</b>  Creates a new category with
   the given name.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="createFilter"></a>
   <b>gameList.createFilter(<i>desc</i>):</b>  Defines a custom filter,
   which selects games for the wheel UI according to a selection rule
   you define.  <i>desc</i> is an object describing the filter.
   Returns a <a href="Commands.html">command ID</a>, automatically
   assigned as a unique menu command for the filter.  You can use
   the command ID to place the filter on custom menus.   See
   <a href="FilterInfo.html#custom">Custom Filters</a> for details
   and examples.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="createMediaType"></a>
   <b>gameList.createMediaType(<i>desc</i>):</b>  Defines a new custom
   media type, which can be used with <a href="CustomWindow.html">Custom Media Windows</a>
   or simply to access other types of media (beyond the standard types
   that PinballY knows about, such as Backglass Images and Table Videos) through Javascript.
   <i>desc</i> is an object describing the new media type; see
   <a href="MediaTypes.html">Media Types</a> for full details on
   using this method to create a new media type.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="createMetaFilter"></a>
   <b>gameList.createMetaFilter(<i>desc</i>):</b>  Creates and installs
   a custom <a href="MetaFilters.html">metafilter</a>.  <i>desc</i> is
   an object describing the new filter.  See <a href="MetaFilters.html">Metafilters</a>
   for more details.  The return value is an opaque
   identifier that uniquely identifies the filter, which can be used
   to later remove the filter via <a href="#removeMetaFilter">removeMetaFilter()</a>.
</p>
<p>
   The new metafilter is placed into effect immediately, and the current
   game selection list in the wheel UI is refreshed so that the new filter
   is taken into account.
</p>
<p>
   A metafilter is a "global" filter that's always active <i>in addition to</i>
   the current user-selected filter, allowing it to further narrow the games
   selected by the regular filter, or even completely override the decisions
   of the regular filter.  More than one metafilter may be active at
   once, so creating a new one doesn't replace or remove any others
   that are already in effect.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="deleteCategory"></a>
   <b>gameList.deleteCategory(<i>name</i>):</b>  Deletes the given
   category.  The category tag is removed from any games tagged with
   the given category, and the category is removed from the master
   list of categories returned by gameList.getAllCategories().
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getAllCategories"></a>
   <b>gameList.getAllCategories():</b>  Returns an array with the names
   of all of the categories currently defined.  Categories are arbitrary
   tags, defined by the user, that can be assigned to games for filtering
   purposes.  Each category implicitly defines a "category filter" that
   the user can select through the menu system to show only games with
   the corresponding category tag.  This lets the user select subsets of
   games based on personal criteria beyond the built-in filter options
   that the system provides.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getAllFilters"></a>
   <b>gameList.getAllFilters():</b>  Returns all of the filters currently
   defined, as an array of <a href="FilterInfo.html">FilterInfo</a>
   objects.  Each object represents one filter.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getAllGames"></a>
   <b>gameList.getAllGames():</b>  Returns an array consisting of a
   <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object for each loaded games.  The
   array is arranged in wheel display order, which is alphabetical by
   the display name of each game.  If you need to iterate over all games,
   this is more efficient than calling getGame() for each game.  In
   addition, the returned array is a snapshot of the complete game list at
   the time you call this function, so it isn't be affected by subsequent
   insertions, deletions, or reorderings of the live game list, as
   getGame() is.  This makes it suitable for making edits to the live
   game list in the course of the iteration, since edits to the live list
   won't affect the snapshot and thus won't affect the iteration.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getAllWheelGames"></a>
   <b>gameList.getAllWheelGames():</b>  Returns an array consisting of a
   <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object for each game on the wheel.
   That is, each game selected by the currently active filter.
   The first (0th) element of the array represents the currently selected game.
   Each subsequent element represents the next game to the right on the wheel.
   Since the wheel is conceptually circular, the last element is the game
   displayed in the wheel one position left from the current game.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getCurFilter"></a>
   <b>gameList.getCurFilter():</b>  Returns a <a href="FilterInfo.html">FilterInfo</a>
   object describing the filter currently selected in the wheel UI.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getFilterInfo"></a>
   <b>gameList.getFilterInfo(<i>id</i>):</b>  Returns a <a href="FilterInfo.html">FilterInfo</a>
   object describing the filter identified by <i>id</i>.  The <i>id</i> value is a string
   with the filter ID.  See <a href="FilterInfo.html#filterID">FilterInfo</a> for details.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getGameInfo"></a>
   <b>gameList.getGameInfo(<i>id</i>):</b>  Returns a <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a>
   object, which has properties to access most of the details of the specified game.
   <i>id</i> can be either a <a href="GameInfo.html#configID">config ID</a> string
   (the permanent identifier for a game, suitable for storing in an external location
   such as a config file) or a numeric <a href="GameInfo.html#gameID">game ID</a>
   (the internal ID that refers to the in-memory record for a loaded game).
   If the ID is invalid or refers to a game that's no longer loaded, the function
   returns null.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getGame"></a>
   <b>gameList.getGame(<i>n</i>):</b>  Returns a <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a>
   object representing the <i>n</i>th game in the loaded game list.  <i>n</i> is an
   index into the list of all loaded games, ranging from 0 to the number of games
   in the list minus 1.  Returns null if <i>n</i> is out of range.  You can get the
   total number of games currently in the list from getGameCount().
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getGameCount"></a>
   <b>gameList.getGameCount():</b>  Returns the number of games in the list of
   all loaded games.  You can retrieve individual games via getGame(<i>n</i>),
   where <i>n</i> ranges from 0 to the game count minus 1.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getMediaDir"></a>
   <b>gameList.getMediaDir():</b>  Returns a string giving the Windows file system
   path of the media folder.  This is the root folder where game media are stored,
   as configured in the option settings.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getWheelGame"></a>
   <b>gameList.getWheelGame(<i>n</i>):</b>  Returns a <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a>
   object representing the game at offset <i>n</i> from the selected game in the wheel.  The
   currently selected game is at offset 0, so gameList.getWheelGame(0) refers
   to the current game.  Offset 1 is the next game to the right of the
   current game, 2 is the next game to the right of that, and so on; -1 is
   the game to the left of the current game, -2 is the game to the left of
   that, and so on.  Since the wheel is conceptually a circle, offset <i>N</i>
   comes back to the currently selected game when <i>N</i> is the number
   of games showing on the wheel (and by the same token, offset <i>-N</i>,
   2<i>N</i>, <i>-2N</i>, etc all wrap back to the current game).
</p>
<p>
   This method is specifically restricted to the games that are included in the
   current game wheel, taking into account the current active filter.  This is
   the same as the list of games that the user can currently navigate through
   via the Next and Previous command buttons.  If the user (or your Javascript
   code) selects a different filter, it will naturally change the list of
   games that this method can access.  If you want to directly access <i>all</i>
   of the games that PinballY current knows about, use the getGame() method
   instead; that gives you access to the entire current list of games.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getWheelCount"></a>
   <b>gameList.getWheelCount():</b>  Returns the number of games currently
   shown in the "wheel" UI.  This includes all games selected by the current
   filter.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="refreshFilter"></a>
   <b>gameList.refreshFilter():</b>  Refreshes the filtered game list, as
   though switching to the current filter anew.  This can be used after
   making any changes to game metadata or other factors that might affect
   which games are selected by the current filter, to ensure that the
   updated selections are immediately reflected in the wheel UI.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="renameCategory"></a>
   <b>gameList.renameCategory(<i>oldName</i>, <i>newName</i>):</b>  Renames
   the given category.  An error occurs if the category referenced by <i>oldName</i>
   doesn't exist, or if there's already an existing category with the new name.
   The category tag is renamed globally, so any games tagged with the old category
   name are updated to the new name.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="removeMetaFilter"></a>
   <b>gameList.removeMetaFilter(<i>id</i>):</b>  Removes the metafilter
   identified by <i>id</i>, which is an identifier returned from a previous
   call to <a href="#createMetaFilter">createMetaFilter()</a>.  This cancels
   the specified metafilter and removes its effect on the game selection list.
   The current wheel selection list is updated as a side effect, as though
   you refreshed the current filter.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="resolveMedia"></a>
   <b>gameList.resolveMedia(<i>subfolder</i>, <i>baseFileName</i>, <i>type</i>):</b>
   Resolves a "global" media file.  Global media are unrelated to any particular
   game; they're used for the default background images when a game has no media of its
   own for a given window, startup audio and video, and for the underlay.  This method
   uses the same search algorithm that the system uses for its own global media files,
   so it ensures that you find the same file the system would for a given case.
   <i>subfolder</i> is a folder name within the main media folder where
   the file is located, such as "Images" or "Videos".  <i>baseFileName</i> is
   the root part of the file name to find, without any path or extension.  <i>type</i>
   is an optional string specifying the media type to search for, which
   determines which filename extensions will be matched, using the same
   file type extensions that the system would use when searching for the
   corresponding media type.  The possible values for <i>type</i> are:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>"audio" = audio files (MP3, WAV)
   <li>"image" = still image files (PNG, JPEG)
   <li>"video" = video files (MP4, etc)
   <li>"wave" = WAVE-format audio files (WAV)
</ul>
<p>
   If you omit <i>type</i> (or set it to an empty string), the method simply
   searches for the exact file name you specify, which in this case must include
   the desired extension.  This lets you limit the search to, say, a .PNG file,
   excluding other image file types that the system would normally accept.
</p>
<p>
   If a matching file is found, the full file name (with path and extension) is
   returned as a string.  If no match is found, <b>undefined</b> is returned.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="setCurFilter"></a>
   <b>gameList.setCurFilter(<i>id</i>):</b>  Changes the active filter
   for the wheel UI.  <i>id</i> can a string with the ID of the desired
   filter, or a number in the range command.FilterFirst to command.FilterLast
   (see <a href="Commands.html">Commands</a>), identifying the filter by
   its associated menu command.  The <a href="FilterSelectEvent.html"><b>filterselect</b></a>
   event is <b>not</b> fired when you change the filter with this function.
   However, a <a href="GameSelectEvent.html">gameselect</a> event <b>is</b>
   fired if the current game selected in the wheel must be changed as a result
   of the filter change.  This happens if the previously selected game isn't
   included by the new filter, requiring the system to automatically switch
   to a game that is included by the new filter.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="setWheelGame"></a>
   <b>gameList.setWheelGame(<i>n</i>, <i>options</i>):</b>  Changes to a
   new game selection in the wheel UI.  <i>n</i> is a number giving the offset
   from the currently selected game, in wheel slots: 1 is the next game to
   the right, 2 is the next game after that, and so on, while -1 is the next
   game to the left, -2 is the next game before that, etc.  Since your
   Javascript code is initiating the game selection change, the
   <a href="GameSelectEvent.html">gameselect</a> event is <b>not</b> fired.
</p>
<p>
   The <i>options</i> argument, if provided, is an object with properties
   that specify how the game change looks in the UI.  If this is omitted,
   the defaults are used for all options:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>animate:</b> boolean, default false.  If set to true, the game
   change is animated with a visible wheel spin effect in the UI, as though
   the user were navigating by pressing the left/right buttons.

   <li><b>fast:</b> boolean, default false.  If set to true, the animation
   effect (if used) runs faster.  The system normally uses the fast mode
   during normal user button navigation when a button is held down long
   enough to auto-repeat, so that the user can zip through the wheel
   very quickly.
</ul>
<p>
   Even when animation mode is used, this method doesn't trigger the sound
   effects or DOF effects that are normally used when the user navigates
   through the wheel with the buttons.  If you want to simulate the exact
   effect of navigating by button presses, you can use
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#doButtonCommand">mainWindow.doButtonCommand()</a>
   with the "Next" and "Prev" button codes.
