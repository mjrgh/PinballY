<h1>HtmlLayout</h1>

<p>
   HtmlLayout is a built-in class for arranging and displaying complex
   text layouts, using standard HTML and CSS to specify the styling
   and arrangement of the text.
</p>
<p>
   This class is a supplement to the basic text drawing functions that
   the <a href="CustomDrawing.html">Custom Drawing</a> system provides.
   The basic text functions operate at the level of drawing glyphs
   at pixel positions, so they're suitable for simple graphics
   that incorporate plain text that's static enough that you can
   position and arrange it in advance.  For more complex text,
   though, the basic drawing functions quickly become unwieldy,
   because they don't provide a way to mix different font
   styles in a single run of text.  You <i>could</i> use the
   Custom Drawing text primitives to compose mixed-style layouts
   out of individual text strings, by measuring and positioning one
   fragment at a time.  Indeed, an earlier version of
   the Custom Drawing chapter rather unhelpfully suggested doing
   just that.  But realistically, it would be too much effort
   for all but the simplest cases, since the details of text
   alignment, spacing, and word-wrapping can be quite complex
   when mixed fonts and styles are involved.
</p>
<p>
   The HtmlLayout class lets you construct a memory object containing
   a text layout based on HTML markup with CSS styling.  This makes
   it a lot easier to specify text that uses a mixture of styles than
   with the basic Custom Drawing primitives, since you don't have to
   make a long series of function calls to switch between different
   styles; you just embed HTML markup commands directly in the text
   to control the style and placement.  The HTML renderer also handles
   the potentially complex details of alignment the text and word-wrapping
   it to fit the available horizontal space.  And the renderer's CSS
   capabilities make it easy to incorporate images, background
   fill, borders, and other decorations.
</p>
<p>
   Once you create an HtmlLayout object containing a text layout, you
   can draw it onto any Custom Drawing surface, such as a Drawing
   Layer.  That lets you mix HtmlLayout text with other graphics
   primitives in the same window.  You can likewise combine multiple
   HtmlLayout objects into the same drawing area.
</p>   
<p>
   For an example of using HtmlLayout, see the "High Score Card"
   example in the <a href="CustomMediaWindowExample.html">Custom Media
   Window</a> section in the <a href="WorkedExamples.html">Worked Examples</a>.
   That example uses HtmlLayout to format a high score listing using
   a mixture of text sizes and styles.
</p>
<p>
   HtmlLayout is a more powerful alternative to
   <a href="StyledText.html">StyledText</a>, which can also lay out
   text with mixed styles, but using a more programming-oriented
   interface than HtmlLayout's markup interface, and without as
   many layout features.  StyledText might be more convenient to
   use for some tasks, especially for simpler layouts.
</p>


<h2>How to use HtmlLayout</h2>
<p>
   The first step is to create a HtmlLayout object based on the
   HTML markup that you want to display.  Do this by using the
   Javascript <b>new</b> operator to create the object:
</p>
<div class="code">
let layout = new HtmlLayout("This is an &lt;i>HTML Layout&lt;/i>!");
</div>

<p>
   The constructor takes a string containing the text to display,
   with standard HTML markup tags to specify the styling.  You can
   use normal HTML and CSS syntax, as though you were creating a Web
   page, although there's no need to create full HTML documents
   with &lt;HTML&gt;, &lt;HEAD&gt;, and &lt;BODY&gt; tags; those
   will be automatically assumed if not present.  You can also
   use CSS to specify the visual style of the text and layout.
</p>
<p>
   There are some limits to the CSS elements that HtmlLayout
   can process; see <a href="#htmlAndCssSupport">HTML and CSS
   support</a> below.  HTML and CSS are inherently forgiving
   of unrecognized elements, so you won't trigger any errors
   if you do try to use CSS features that aren't supported;
   the unsupported features will simply be ignored.  Generally,
   the renderer has good support for what I'd consider the
   core text layout features, such as fonts, colors, backgrounds,
   borders, alignment, padding, and margins.
</p>
<p>
   It's important to understand that HtmlLayout is just a
   <i>renderer</i>, not a full browser.  It doesn't have any
   interactive capabilities, such as clicking on a hyperlink
   or filling in a form.  It's a very simple display-only
   object used to draw graphics on the screen.  This means
   that the HTML you pass to the constructor can't contain
   any Javascript code, for example.  (Actually, it's perfectly
   okay for it to contain Javascript code, but HtmlLayout will
   just ignore it, so there'd be no point.)  Likewise, you can
   include hyperlinks, and they'll be <i>displayed</i> like
   hyperlinks, but they won't be "live" - nothing will happen
   if you click on them with the mouse.
</p>
   
<p>
   HtmlLayout objects are independent of any other drawing
   objects - you don't need a Drawing Layer or Custom Drawing
   context to create an HtmlLayout.  HtmlLayout is just an
   encapsulation of the HTML text you pass in when creating it,
   so it's not directly tied to any particular window or drawing
   operation.  You can create an HtmlLayout at any time, even when
   a drawing operation isn't in progress, and you can hold onto
   it indefinitely for future use.  Likewise, you can reuse the
   same HtmlLayout repeatedly to draw its contents in different
   windows.
</p>
<p>
   Once you've created an HtmlLayout object, you can use it for
   two main purposes: measuring the pixel size of its overall
   contents as it will appear on screen, and drawing the contents
   into a window or other drawing context.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Drawing:</b>  To draw the contents of the layout, you have to go
   through the standard <a href="CustomDrawing.html">Custom Drawing</a>
   procedure for drawing in a drawing layer or other suitable
   context.  The HtmlLayout contents can then be drawn within
   the "drawing callback function" you define.  Your drawing
   function receives a <a href="CustomDrawing.html#drawingContext">drawing context</a>
   object as its argument, and this object is needed to
   draw the HtmlLayout.
</p>
<p>
   Once you're in a custom drawing function and have a
   drawing context object available, drawing the HtmlLayout
   is just a matter of calling its <b>draw()</b> method.
   The arguments to this method are the drawing context
   object, and the boundaries of the rectangular area within the
   window where you want to display the text: left coordinate,
   top coordinate, width, and height, all in pixels.
</p>
<p>
   For example, here's how you'd render some HTML in a Drawing
   Layer object, positioning it at the top left of the layer's
   drawing area, and giving it full run of the available space:
</p>
<div class="javascript code">
let layout = new HtmlLayout("This is some &lt;b>HTML&lt;/b>!");
myDrawingLayer.draw(dc => {
    let size = dc.getSize();
    layout.draw(dc, { x: 0, y: 0, width: size.width, height: size.height });
}, 640, 480);
</div>

<p>
   <b>Measuring the layout:</b>  One of the key abilities that
   HtmlLayout gives you is automatic word-wrapping and text
   alignment, taking into account all of the different styles
   of the text it contains and the bounds of the area it'll be
   drawn into.  You can measure the effect of the word-wrapping
   using the <b>measure()</b> method, specifying the width of
   the available space.  That will do all of the HTML layout
   calculations to determine how much vertical space is
   needed to fit the resulting text.  It'll also
   tell you the actual width needed, which might be a
   little different from the bounding-box width you
   specified, since the word breaks might fall in such
   a way that none of the lines fully fill out the
   available width (and, in some cases, text that can't
   be broken across lines might exceed the available width).
</p>
<div class="code">
// measure the layout bounds with a width of 250 pixels
let layout = new HtmlLayout("This is some &lt;b>HTML&lt;/b>!");
let size = layout.measure(250);
</div>
<p>
   The measure() method returns an object containing two
   properties, <b>width</b> and <b>height</b>, giving
   the dimensions needed to contain the HTML contents.
   The dimensions include space needed for everything
   in the HTML, including things like padding
   and borders, so this is the exact amount of space
   needed to draw the entire thing.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Interaction with other drawing primitives:</b>  HtmlLayout
   does its actual drawing using a <a href="CustomDrawing.html">Custom Drawing</a>
   graphics context, just like all of the Custom Drawing functions,
   so you can freely combine it with the other drawing functions
   to build up composite graphics out of different elements.
   Drawing the layout object simply draws pixels into the in-memory
   bitmap that the drawing function is constructing, just like
   drawing a simple text string via the drawing context's
   <a href="CustomDrawing.html#drawText">drawText()</a> method.
   Drawing an HtmlLayout object into a drawing context is similar
   to drawing an image file - it just draws pixels into the
   drawing area, leaving the drawing area ready for you to
   draw more pixels into it as desired.
</p>
<p>
   The default background color for the HtmlLayout DOM tree
   is transparent.  That makes it easy to use it to overlay text
   on top of other background graphics.  The usual procedure to
   draw a full window's contents would be to start by filling
   the background with a solid color or with a loaded image file,
   then to draw text and other graphics over the background.
   You can include HtmlLayout objects in that iterative
   sort of drawing process just like
   any of the other graphics primitives.
</p>
<p>
   HtmlLayout <i>isn't</i> a kind of "text", as far the drawing
   context is concerned.  In particular, HtmlLayout doesn't in
   any way affect (or use) any the text-related "status" elements
   in the drawing context.  It doesn't use or affect
   the text origin, text bounding box, of any of the font, size,
   style, or color attributes in the drawing context.
</p>

<a name="propertiesAndMethods"></a>
<h2>Properties and methods</h2>
<p>
   HtmlLayout has the following properties and methods:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>new HtmlLayout(<i>htmlSourceCode</i>):</b>  Create a new
   HtmlLayout object.  <i>htmlSourceCode</i> is a string with the
   HTML markup information that the object will
   display.  This uses standard HTML, with CSS <b>style</b>
   attributes as desired to control visual styling.
   <p>
      Creating the object parses the HTML and creates a DOM tree
      internally.  The DOM tree isn't currently accessible through
      Javascript, so you can't go in and traverse the tree or
      modify nodes.  But it's stored in the object so that you
      can measure the layout and draw it into any drawing context.
   </p>


   <li><b><i>htmlLayout</i>.draw(<i>drawingContext</i>, <i>layoutRect</i>, <i>clipRect</i>):</b>
   Draw the object's contents (defined when it was created with <b>new</b>) into
   the <a href="CustomDrawing.html#drawingContext">drawing context</a>,
   laying it out to fit the layout area given by <i>layoutRect</i>.
   <p>
      The <i>drawingContext</i> object is the argument that the system
      passes to your custom drawing function when you use a
      <a href="DrawingLayer.html">Drawing Layer</a> or other
      <a href="CustomDrawing.html">Custom Drawing</a> mechanism.
      As a result, you can only call the HtmlLayout <b>draw()</b> method from
      within one a drawing function, since that's the only place where
      a drawing context is valid.  (This restriction doesn't apply to
      other HtmlLayout operations, though.  You can create an
      HtmlLayout object at any time, and you can hold onto it
      and use it in as many different drawing operations as
      you want.  The HtmlLayout object itself isn't tied to
      a particular window or drawing operation; it's just an
      encapsulation of the DOM tree for the HTML.)
   </p>
   <p>
      The layout rectangle is more of a suggestion than a hard
      limit on the layout.  Text doesn't always fit where you want
      it to; a single word, or even a single glyph, might be too wide to fit the available
      width, for example, or there might be so much text that it
      exceeds the specified height.
   </p>
   <p>
      The layout rectangle is also the outer reference frame for
      text alignment within the HTML.  It takes the place of the
      "viewport" in a normal browser, which is in most cases
      the browser window.
      If you create a DIV with center alignment, for example,
      its contents be drawn centered within the layout rectangle.
      Likewise, text that's right-aligned in the markup will be drawn
      aligned to the right side of the layout rectangle.
   </p>
   <p>
      <i>clipRect</i> is optional.  If it's included, the drawing will
      be "clipped" to this area, meaning that pixels outside of this
      area will simply not be drawn.  Clipping doesn't attempt to
      keep whole characters intact, since it's simply at the pixel
      level; it can result in characters being chopped in half
      vertically or horizontally if they spill outside of the
      clipping boundaries.  If <i>clipRect</i> is omitted (the
      argument is missing, or you explicitly pass <b>undefined</b>),
      the drawing isn't clipped, so it can affect pixels outside of the layout
      rectangle.
   </p>
   <p>
      Both rectangles (<i>layoutRect</i> and <i>clipRect</i>) are
      specified as objects, with properties { x, y, width, height },
      giving the upper left corner of the rectangle, and its size.
      As with all Custom Drawing coordinates, the rectangle coordinates
      are all in terms of pixel positions within the Custom Drawing
      surface, starting with (0,0) at the upper left corner of the
      drawing surface.
   </p>

   <li><b><i>htmlLayout</i>.measure(<i>width</i>):</b>
   Measure the space needed for the graphical layout of the DOM tree
   in the object, including all of its contents as well as borders
   and padding.  The space is calculated based on rendering the
   contents to the specified display width, given in pixels.
   <p>
      The method returns an object with properties <b>width</b>
      and <b>height</b>, giving the dimensions of the rendered
      contents, in pixels.  This is the bounding box of the
      overall contents, including borders and padding.
   </p>
</ul>

<a name="htmlAndCssSupport"></a>
<h2>HTML and CSS support</h2>
<p>
<p>
   HtmlLayout is based on an open-source HTML parsing and rendering engine
   called <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mjrgh/litehtml">litehtml</a>.
   Litehtml has full support for HTML5, and properly handles most
   of the basic CSS2/CSS3 styling elements.  It doesn't have support
   for the more advanced features of modern browsers, such as
   animation, transitions, or transforms, but it does handle the
   core text formatting functions: fonts, colors, backgrounds,
   borders, alignment, padding, margins.
</p>
<p>
   For a full list of supported CSS elements, see the
   <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mjrgh/litehtml">litehtml project page</a>.
   That includes a table of the CSS features currently supported.  (It
   looks a little skimpy to me, as though the code author might have
   started working on it but forgot finish it, so I'm not
   sure it's all that comprehensive or up-to-date with the code.
   But it should at least give you an idea of what's supposed to work.)
</p>
<p>
   <b>&lt;IMG&gt; tags:</b>  Only local files are supported.
   Simply use a local filename path in the <b>SRC</b> attribute.
   Regular URLs aren't supported here - don't use an "http:" or "file:" prefix.
</p>
<p>
   If you include an animated GIF image, it'll just display the first
   frame, without any further animation.  This is another consequence
   of the fact that HtmlLayout is just a renderer, not a live browser;
   it just renders a static image of the laid-out HTML, so incorporating
   an active object like an animated GIF will just display a still image
   of that object.  Other more explicitly active objects, like video
   players, aren't supported at all.
</p>
<p>
   <b>url() images in CSS:</b>  The same things we said above about
   &lt;IMG&gt; tags apply here.  You can use local image files simply by
   specifying a local file system path in the url() specifier.  Don't
   use an "http:" or "file:" URL prefix.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Mouse and keyboard interaction:</b>  Not supported.  HtmlLayout is just
   an HTML <i>renderer</i>: it merely draws the HTML text statically,
   as though drawing a still image on the screen.  Nothing in the
   drawing is interactive, so you can't click on links or anything
   like that.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Javascript DOM interaction:</b>  Not supported.  The HtmlLayout
   object is just for drawing; it doesn't expose a live DOM tree for access
   through Javascript.  The only things you can do with the HtmlLayout
   object are exposed through the <a href="#propertiesAndMethods">properties and methods</a>
   listed above.
