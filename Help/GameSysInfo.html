<h1>GameSysInfo</h1>

<p>
   A GameSysInfo object provides information on the PinballY
   configuration settings for a game player system, such as
   Visual Pinball or Future Pinball. 
</p>
<p>
   PinballY has very little built-in knowledge about the
   different player systems.  PinballY tries to treat each system
   the same way, as a generic external program, with all of the
   information about playing a game with a given system captured
   in the configuration settings.  As a result, almost everything
   that PinballY knows about a system is accessible to Javascript
   code via the GameSysInfo object.
</p>
<p>
   The properties of the GameSysInfo object are actually "getter"
   methods that return live information from PinballY's internal
   configuration data for the various systems.  You can't change
   these values by assigning to the properties.
</p>

<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>
   You don't create GameSysInfo objects directly.  You get these
   objects from PinballY whenever it references player systems.
   The main source is the <b>system</b> property of the
   <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object, which indicates
   which system a particular game is associated with.
</p>

<h2>Lifetime</h2>
<p>
   A GameSysInfo object is a Javascript object, so it stays valid
   as long as you keep a reference to it from somewhere in your
   Javascript code.  The underlying system object that serves as
   the data source for the properties, however, can be affected
   by changes to the settings.  For this reason, it's best to
   avoid storing references to these objects in global variables
   or object properties.
</p>

<h2>Properties and methods</h2>

<p>
   <b>databaseDir:</b> A string giving the name of the folder
   containing the XML database files that list this system's configured
   games.  This is the name of the folder only, with no path; the
   full path is based on the system-wide database folder setting.
   See <a href="DirectoryInfo.html#tableDatabases">Table Databases</a>
   for details on how these folders are laid out.
</p>

<p>
   <b>dbFiles:</b> An array of objects describing the table database
   files found for this system.  The table database files are the XML
   files that list the games associated with this system and store most
   of the metadata for each game (title, manufacturer, year, etc).
   Each system can have one or more of these XML files.  There's always
   a primary "generic" file, whose full path is given by the <b>genericDbFile</b>
   property, and which also appears in this list.  Any additional files
   are "category" files.  These have exactly the same layout as the
   primary file, but the games in any of these additional files are
   implicitly given category tags matching the filename of the
   containing XML file.  For example, if there's a file called
   "Fantasy.xml" in the database folder, the games listed in this file
   are given the category tag "Fantasy".  This multi-file layout is
   for compatibility with HyperPin and PinballX, which use it as a
   simple category scheme that can assign each game to one
   category.  PinballY has a more generalized category scheme that
   lets you assign any number of category tags to a game, which it
   handles through the separate GameStats.csv database file, but 
   PinballY also recognizes the legacy file structure, so that
   existing database files can be used directly.
</p>
<p>
   Each object in the dbFiles array corresponds to one such file,
   and has the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>category:</b>  If this file defines a category, the category
   name as a string.  This is omitted for the primary "generic" XML
   file for the system, which doesn't imply any category tags.

   <li><b>categoryFilter:</b>  A <a href="FilterInfo.html">FilterInfo</a>
   object describing the category filter.  This is omitted for the
   primary "generic" XML file for the system.
   
   <li><b>filename:</b> The full filename (with absolute path) of
   the database file.
</ul>

<p>
   <b>defExt:</b> The default filename extension for the system's game
   files, including the initial period: ".vpt" for Visual Pinball 9,
   for example.  An empty string if the system has no default extension.
</p>

<p>
   <b>displayName:</b> The display name of the system.  This is the
   name used to refer to the system in the UI, such as in the settings
   dialog, game information popups, etc.
</p>

<p>
   <b>dofTitlePrefix:</b> The prefix string used to form DOF ROM names
   for games of this system.  For example, Future Pinball uses "FP:" as
   a prefix for its DOF entries, to distinguish games from the
   Visual Pinball equivalents.
</p>

<p>
   <b>envVars:</b>  A string giving any environment variables added to
   the system environment variable block when launching the system's
   executable to play a game.  The standard format for Windows environment
   variables is used, "VAR=VALUE".  Multiple variables are separated by
   semicolons.
</p>

<p>
   <b>exe:</b>  A string giving the filename (with full absolute path)
   of the program executable (.EXE file) for the game system.  This
   is just the filename, with no command-line parameters; parameters are
   stored separately in <b>params</b>.
</p>

<p>
   <b>expand(<i>str</i>, <i>game</i>):</b>  Expand command-line substitution
   variables in the string <i>str</i>, using the game details from <i>game</i>,
   a <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object specifying a game to use.
   Subsitution variables can be specified using [square brackets] in the
   <b>params</b> and <b>runXxx</b> variables.  This method carries out the
   same variable substitutions that PinballY would normally apply when
   launching the given game with this system.  <i>game</i> should be a game
   associated with this system; the results aren't meaningful for games
   associated with other systems.
</p>
   

<p>
   <b>genericDbFile:</b>  The filename (with full absolute path) of the
   primary "generic" XML database file for the system.  This is the main
   file, which doesn't imply any category tags for its games.  This file
   also appears in the <b>dbFiles</b> array.
</p>

<p>
   <b>mediaDir:</b> A string giving the name of the parent folder
   for media files (table images, table videos, etc) for games based on
   this system.  This is the parent folder name only, with no path; the
   full path is based on the system-wide root media folder path.  This
   is the "parent" folder in that all of the individual media files are
   in type-specific subdirectories within this folder.  See
   <a href="DirectoryInfo.html#mediaFiles">Media Files</a> for more
   details on the media folder structure.
</p>

<p>
   <b>nvramPath:</b>  The path to the NVRAM (non-volatile RAM) files
   for the system, as specified in the configuration.  This is for
   the sake of the PinEMHi high-scores program, which uses the NVRAM
   files to read high score information.  This is usually an empty
   string, which means that the standard NVRAM path location for
   each system is used.  PinEMHi currently only works with Future
   Pinball games and VPinMAME ROM-based games, so this isn't meaningful
   for other systems.
</p>

<p>
   <b>params:</b>  The command-line parameters to use when launching
   the system's executable to play a game.  This is the "raw" version
   of the parameters, which can contain substitution variables
   enclosed in [square brackets].  See <a href="SystemOptions.html#parameters">Parameters</a>
   in the System Options dialog for a list of the substitution variables.
</p>

<p>
   <b>processName:</b>  A string giving the process name to monitor
   when the game is running, to determine when the game has terminated.
   This is used for systems where the program specified in the <b>exe</b>
   parameter is actually just a launcher that starts the real game
   program, such as Steam.  This is an empty string for most systems,
   where the process to be monitored is the same as the program
   specified in <b>exe</b>.
</p>

<p>
   <b>runAfter:</b>  A string giving the "Run After" command, which is
   invoked after a game launched using this system terminates.  The main
   PinballY window displays a "Game Exiting" message while this command
   is running.  This is given as a full Windows command line string,
   specifying a program to be run and its parameters.
</p>

<p>
   <b>runAfterPost:</b>  A string giving the "Run After Post" command.  This
   is a second "after" command that runs after the <b>runAfter</b> command.
   The main PinballY window is cleared to show only a blank, black background
   while this command is running.  This is a full Windows command line string,
   specifying a program to be run and its parameters.
</p>

<p>
   <b>runBefore:</b>  A string giving the "Run Before" command, which is
   invoked immediately before a game for this system is launched, after the
   "Launching" message has been displayed in the PinballY main window.
   This is a full Windows command line string, specifying a program to be
   run and its parameters.
</p>
<p>
   <b>runBeforePre:</b>  A string giving the "Run Before Pre" command, which is
   invoked as the first step in launching a game with the system, with the
   main PinballY window showing nothing but a blank, black background.  This is
   a full Windows command line string, specifying a program to be run and its
   parameters.
</p>

<p>
   <b>startupKeys:</b>  A string giving a sequence of keystrokes to
   send to the program after it launches.
</p>

<p>
   <b>swShow:</b>  An integer giving the Windows "Show Window" code to use
   when launching the system's executable.  This can be any valid Show Window
   code (see the Windows SDK documentation for the full list), but it's
   usually one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>0 (SW_HIDE) - hide the window
   <li>2 (SW_SHOWMINIMIZED) - minimize the window and make it active (that is, give it keyboard focus)
   <li>5 (SW_SHOW) - show the window normally and make it active
</ul>

<p>
   <b>systemClass:</b>  A string with the "system class". This is one
   of the following:
</p>
<ul class="compact">
   <li><b>"FP"</b> - Future Pinball (any version)
   <li><b>"STEAM"</b> - any Steam-based game
   <li><b>"VP"</b> - Visual Pinball 9 or earlier
   <li><b>"VPX"</b> - Visual Pinball 10
   <li><b>""</b> - any other system
</ul>
<p>
   Note that PinballY tries to treat each system as an equal "black box",
   with all of the information about a system captured in the settings.
   There's almost nothing in PinballY that depends on knowing if a system
   is a Visual Pinball variant or whatever else.  The black box approach
   is important because it makes the program adaptable to new systems
   and future versions of existing systems.  The only places that PinballY
   uses the system class internally are (1) to streamline the settings
   dialogs, by filling in suitable defaults when possible, (2) to provide
   intelligent defaults for missing information when loading the config files,
   and (3) when invoking PinEMHi to get high scores, since that program has
   hard-coded dependencies on VP and FP.
</p>

<p>
   <b>tablePath:</b>  The full absolute directory path for the playable
   game files for this system.  For Visual Pinball, for example, this is
   usually the Tables folder within the VP program folder.
</p>
<p>
   <b>terminateBy:</b>  A string giving the termination mode for the
   program, which determines how PinballY tries to terminate a running
   game when the user presses the "Exit Game" button.  This can one
   of the following:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>"CloseWindow" - PinballY closes the program's main window and waits
   for the process to exit on its own
   <li>"KillProcess" - PinballY asks Windows to terminate the process
   (without going through the program's user interface)
   <li>"" - use the default (same as CloseWindow)
</ul>

<p>
   <b>workingPath:</b>  The working directory path to use when launching
   the system's executable, as a full absolute path.  This sets the current
   working directory for the child process, which determines its default
   folder location if it accesses files without absolute path specifiers.
   This is usually the same as the folder containing the program exectuable.
