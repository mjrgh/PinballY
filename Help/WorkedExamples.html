<h1>Worked Examples</h1>

<p>
   The Javascript engine in PinballY is pretty powerful, but as with
   most programming tools, it can have a bit of a learning
   curve.  I've tried to make it approachable for people who already
   know their way around Javascript, but there's still a lot of new
   information to take in because of the breadth of the interface
   between Javascript and PinballY.
</p>
<p>
   To help you get started, this section contains some worked
   examples.  I think most people find it easiest to learn new
   programming tasks by example, so hopefully this will ease the
   learning curve a bit.  At the very least, it might give you
   a feel for the sorts of things you can do with Javascript
   and some pointers for where to start.  I've tried to choose tasks
   that aren't just contrived exercises, but do things
   that might actually be useful.  In fact, most are based
   on actual use cases that came up talking to people using the
   program.  I've also tried to flesh out the examples enough
   to be usable as presented.
</p>
<p>
   If you're new to Javascript itself, you might want to spend a
   little time with a Javascript tutorial before diving into the
   examples, so that the basic syntax makes sense.  These examples
   are designed more to illustrate how to use PinballY features
   than as examples of Javascript coding techniques, since there
   are already so many good Javascript tutorials available online.
</p>

<p>
   Here are the examples:

<h2>How to use the examples on your system</h2>

<p>
   When PinballY starts up, it looks for a file in the PinballY
   Scripts folder called Main.js.  If that file exists, PinballY
   enables Javascript, reads the file, and executes the program
   code it contains.  You can read more about this in the
   main <a href="Javascript.html">Javascript Scripting</a>
   help section.
</p>
<p>
   To use any of the examples, then, you could simply copy and
   paste the code sections you want to use into Main.js.  However,
   I'd recommend a different approach.  Rather than
   putting everything in that single file Main.js, I'd use a
   separate file for each "feature", and then use the Javascript
   <b>import()</b> command to load each file from Main.js.  By
   "feature", I just mean a body of related Javascript code
   that works as a unit.  Keeping each feature in its own
   separate file will make it easier to keep track of which
   code does what.
</p>
<p>
   For example, to add a Top 10 Filter to your system:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Copy the desired code from the Top 10 Filter chapter to a new file
      in your PinballY Scripts folder - let's call it <b>TopGames.js</b>

   <li>In Main.js, add this code: <b>import("TopGames.js");</b>
</ul>
