<h1>Calling Native DLLs from Javascript</h1>

<p>
   PinballY has a special set of Javascript extensions for calling
   external native code.  These extensions are available through
   a system object called <b>dllImport</b>.
   (Oof, that's full of ambiguous looking letters, isn't it?  That's
   D-L-L-Import, DLL standing for Dynamic Link Library.)
</p>
<p>
   DLL Importing can be used to make calls directly to most Windows API
   functions from Javascript, to access system functionality beyond what's
   provided through the Javascript classes provided in PinballY.  Rather
   than trying to provide built-in Javascript support for the massive
   number of Windows API functions, we thought it would work better
   in the long run to let you call Windows yourself, directly.
</p>
<p>
   You can also use DLL importing
   to call your own custom code, written in any other programming
   language that can create DLLs, such as C, C++, Visual Basic, or C#.
   The PinballY DLL import system tries to make it relatively painless
   to call external code, by providing automatic type conversions
   between Javascript and native types, so that you can call external
   functions directly without having to worry too much about type
   conversions.
</p>
<p>
   The DLL import feature is a PinballY add-on.  You
   won't find it in Web browsers or in standard Javascript.  (Which
   also means you won't be able to read about it in other Javascript
   manuals; you'll have to make do with the material here.)
</p>
<p>
   The obvious warnings about calling out to native code apply: simple
   errors in native code calls can crash the whole program, and if
   you get creative enough, you can 
   even destabilize the system, corrupt disk files, or do
   other system damage.  Javascript and PinballY can't do much to
   protect against errant calls through the DLL layer, because the
   whole point is to give you access to the broader Windows
   native environment, which is all beyond the reach of Javascript's
   supervision.
</p>

<h2>An example</h2>
<p>
   The DLL importer combines quite a lot of concepts and
   technologies, so there's a lot to cover.  Before we get into
   the details, it might help to look at an example, to
   see how all of the pieces fit together.
</p>
<p>
   This example uses a few basic Windows API calls to get a list
   of the current top-level windows on the desktop.  One important
   thing to notice is that we're calling Windows functions
   <i>directly from Javascript</i>, without having to write any
   DLL code of our own.   This is a complete example that you can
   drop into your main.js file and run, without having to set
   anything up outside of PinballY.  (You can <i>also</i> use the
   DLL importer to call your own DLL code, but the point here
   is that you don't have to write a DLL just to call Windows
   functions.  The DLL importer lets you call just about any
   native code directly.)
</p>
<p>
   If you're already familiar with the basic principles of using
   DLLs in other languages - C, C++, C#, Visual Basic - you'll
   find that the basic process of calling a DLL is the same.
   The only differences come from the need to reconcile
   Javascript's very abstract dataype system with the low-level
   types used in native code.  The DLL importer tries to smooth
   over those differences and make the exchange of data relatively
   automatic and painless, but there are some details that
   unavoidably poke through the covers.
</p>

<div class="code">
// Define the native struct types used in the DLL functions we
// want to call.  These definitions go into an internal table in
// the dllImport object, so we can refer to the types by name in
// subsequent bind() calls once they're defined.  We use "C"
// language syntax to define native types, since that's what
// all of the Windows APIs use.  That way, we can usually just
// copy and paste definitions from the SDKs.  There's no need
// to puzzle out how the types map to Javascript; we just state
// everything directly in terms of the original, native types.
dllImport.define(`
    typedef struct _RECT {
        LONG left;
        LONG top;
        LONG right;
        LONG bottom;
    } RECT, *PRECT, *LPRECT;
    typedef BOOL (CALLBACK *WNDENUMPROC)(HWND hwnd, LPARAM lParam);
`);

// Bind the DLL functions we want to call.  This step creates a
// callable Javascript function for each DLL function we need.
// This is a one-time step; we can call these functions repeatedly
// once they're bound.
//
// The return value from bind() is an object, with properties
// named for the functions declared.  E.g., User32.GetDesktopWindow()
// will be a Javascript function we can call to invoke the native
// Windows routine GetDesktopWindow().
let User32 = dllImport.bind("User32.dll", `
    HWND WINAPI GetDesktopWindow();
    BOOL WINAPI EnumChildWindows(HWND hwnd, WNDENUMPROC lpEnumFunc, LPARAM lParam);
    BOOL WINAPI GetParent(HWND hwnd);
    BOOL WINAPI GetWindowTextW(HWND hwnd, LPWSTR buf, int nMaxCount);
    BOOL WINAPI GetWindowRect(HWND hWnd, LPRECT lpRect);
`);

// Create a string buffer for retrieving window titles.  Unicode
// characters are equivalent to 16-bit integers, so we need a Uint16
// typed array to receive the string data.  Uint16Array is a
// standard built-in Javascript type that we can use anywhere a
// Unicode string buffer is needed in a DLL call.
//
// One of the things that makes "C" style functions (like Win API
// call!) harder to use than Javascript is that most strings have
// to be set up as fixed-length character buffers.  We have to
// pre-allocate this array with the maximum string length we're
// willing to accept.
let title = new Uint16Array(256);

// Create a native RECT struct for retrieving window coordinates.
// The DLL importer lets us create native structs of any type that
// we've defined via dllImport.define().
let rc = dllImport.create("RECT");

// Make a list of the names and positions of the direct children
// of the main desktop window.  EnumChildWindows() is one of those
// Windows functions that takes a "callback" function defined by
// the caller.  Windows calls this function repeatedly, once for
// each window.  We can provide a Javascript anonymous function
// as the callback.
let wins = [];
let parent = User32.GetDesktopWindow();
User32.EnumChildWindows(parent, (hwnd) =&gt; {
    if (User32.GetParent(hwnd) == parent)
    {
        User32.GetWindowTextW(hwnd, title, title.length);
        User32.GetWindowRect(hwnd, rc);
        wins.push({
            title: title.toString(),
            rc: { left: rc.left, top: rc.top, right: rc.right, bottom: rc.bottom }
        });
    }
});
</div>

   

<h2>Binding a function</h2>
<p>
   To call an external DLL function, you first have to "bind" the DLL
   function.  This step connects the native code to Javascript.  You
   tell the system the name of the DLL you want to call, the name
   of the function in the DLL, and the "type signature" of the
   function, meaning the datatypes of the arguments and
   return value.  The bind operation uses that information to load
   the DLL into memory (if it's not already loaded), look up the
   native code address of the function, and create a Javascript
   function that represents the native code function. 
</p>

<div class="code">
let User32 = dllImport.bind("User32.dll", "HWND WINAPI GetDesktopWindow()");
</div>

<p>
   <b>Important:</b> Be sure to use <b>WINAPI</b> keyword when required.
   Almost all Windows API functions use it.  This specifies the "calling
   convention", which determines how arguments are passed on the native stack
   when calling the native function.  Using the wrong calling convention
   will corrupt memory, which can crash the whole program or cause
   erratic behavior.
</p>

<p>
   The return value from bind() is an object, containing one property
   for each function you declared, with the same name as the function.
   For example, in the call above, we get an object with the one
   property <b>GetDesktopWindow</b>.
</p>
<p>
   Each property of the bind() object is a callable Javascript
   function that invokes the corresponding native DLL function.  So
   when we want to call the native GetDesktopWindow() function, we
   can now just write:
</p>
<div class="code">
let hwnd = User32.GetDesktopWindow();
</div>
<p>
   The first argument to bind() is the name of the DLL, in this case
   the standard Windows library User32.dll, which contains many of the
   basic UI functions in Windows.  The second argument is the declaration
   of the function's return type and argument types using "C" programming
   language syntax.
</p>
<p>
   The DLL importer uses C syntax for the function declarations primarily
   because that's what's the Microsoft API documentation uses almost
   everywhere.  This
   makes it easy to copy and paste API definitions from the SDK
   documentation directly into your Javascript code, often with no
   changes.  The C syntax is used in all cases, even if you're using
   a DLL written in some language other than C.  You can't substitute VB
   or C# syntax; you have to translate it to C terms.
</p>

<p>
   You can bind several functions in the same DLL at once.  You can do
   this in two ways:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Use a long string with multiple function declarations, with a semicolon (;)
   at the end of each name
   <li>Use an array of strings
</ul>

<p>
   The Javascript "back-quote" notation is especially handy for the
   long string option, since it lets you spread out a string across
   multiple lines.  That makes a long list of declarations easily
   readable.

<div class="code">
User32 = dllImport.bind("User32.dll", `
   HWND WINAPI GetDesktopWindow();
   BOOL WINAPI GetWindowRect(HWND, LPRECT);
`);
</div>

<h2>DLL filenames and paths</h2>
<p>
   When you bind a function, the DLL name you specify can be a plain filename,
   such as the "User32.dll" we've been using in our examples, or it can use a
   full, absolute path.  In the absence of a
   path, Windows will look in the PinballY program folder for the DLL and
   then in the standard Windows system folders.  That makes it a no-brainer
   to always use plain filenames (with no path) for all standard Windows DLLs.
   Custom DLLs of your own are also best loaded with no path name, as
   a path name will create headaches if you ever move any files around.
   It's best to copy your custom DLLs into the PinballY program folder
   to ensure that they can be found without having to specify any
   paths.
</p>

<h2>Windows SDK "A" and "W" functions</h2>
<p>
   Many of the common
   Windows API functions have slightly different names in the DLL than in
   the SDK documentation.  For example, there's no actual DLL function
   called MessageBox.  Instead, there are two variants of the functions,
   one called MessageBoxA and  one called MessageBoxW.  The "A" stands for
   ANSI (8-bit character strings), and the "W" is for WIDE (16-bit Unicode
   strings).
</p>
<p>
   Most Windows API functions that take character string arguments
   (directly or within structs) have these "A" and "W" variants.  If
   you run into any strange missing function errors, double-check the
   SDK documentation to see if the function you're trying to call
   needs an "A" or "W" suffix.
<p>
   In PinballY Javascript, it's best to use the "W" variants when you're
   faced with a choice.  Javascript itself uses Unicode for all strings
   internally, so you'll avoid unnecessary string conversions by using
   the "W" functions.
</p>

<h2>Calling a bound function</h2>

<p>
   Once a DLL function is bound, you invoke the DLL function simply
   by calling the Javascript function returned from the "bind" call.
</p>

<div class="code">
let User32 = dllImport.bind("User32.dll", "HWND WINAPI GetDesktopWindow()");
let hwndDesktop = User32.GetDesktopWindow();
</div>

<p>
   When you call a bound function, the argument type list that you provided
   in the "bind" call is used to automatically convert arguments from
   Javascript format to the native datatypes, and to convert the return
   value from native format back to Javascript.  That means you don't have to
   worry too much about the type conversion details when you call a bound DLL
   function; you can mostly just treat it like any other Javascript function.
   See <a href="#typeConversions">below</a> for details on the how automatic
   type conversions are handled.
</p>

<a name="outParams"></a>
<h2>"Out" pointer parameters</h2>

<p>
   Many Windows API functions return information in "out" parameters.
   That means that you pass a <i>pointer to a variable</i> to the
   function, and the function writes some result information into
   that variable before returning.
</p>
<p>
   Javascript doesn't have any concept of "pointer to a variable".
   The closest equivalent in Javascript is that you can pass an
   object to a function, and the function can modify the properties
   of that object before returning.  But that obviously won't
   work with native code, which has no idea what a Javascript
   object looks like.
</p>
<p>
   To deal with this mismatch, the DLL importer lets you create
   native data objects, which you can then pass to DLL functions
   in the arguments.  
</p>
<p>
   For example, suppose you wanted to call a function that returns
   information in an "int" (integer) variable:
</p>
<div class="code">
let MyDll = dllImport.bind("MyDll.dll", "void GetInfo(int *result)");
</div>

<p>
   In C or C++, it's easy to call a function like this: you just
   pass the address of an "int" variable with the "&amp;" operator.
   But of course that doesn't exist Javascript, nor does the entire
   concept of the "address" of something.  So how do we
   call this function?  The answer is that we have to create a
   <i>native</i> "int" variable, not a Javascript variable.  We
   do that through dllImport.create(), specifying the type of the
   variable we want to create:
</p>
<div class="code">
let i = dllImport.create("int");
</div>

<p>
   Things get pretty trippy at this point; I hope you liked
   <i>Inception</i>.  <b>i</b> is a Javascript
   variable that contains a Javascript object representing a native
   <b>int</b> variable.  If you look at <b>i</b> itself, you'll see
   a Javascript object.  If you want to get to the native <b>int</b>
   variable, you can use <b>i.value</b>, which is a getter/setter
   property that accesses the underlying native <b>int</b>
   variable.  If you assign to <b>i.value</b>, you'll store a
   value in the native variable.  If you use <b>i.value</b> in
   an expression, you'll get a Javascript number corresponding
   to the native <b>int</b> value.  
</p>
<img src="NativeObject illustration.png" class="example">
<p>
   If you pass <b>i</b> to a DLL function that requires a
   <i>pointer to</i> a native int, the DLL importer
   will pass the address of the native <b>int</b> variable.  So
   this is the answer to the earlier question of how we call
   that GetInfo() function that requires a pointer to an int.
</p>
<div class="code">
// call DLL function "void GetInfo(int *result)", passing
// a pointer to the native int stored in NativeObject i
MyDll.GetInfo(i);

// on return, i.value reflects what GetInfo wrote into *result
alert("The result from GetInfo is " + i.value);
</div>

<p>
   For more on using these special native value containers,
   see <a href="NativeObject.html">NativeObject objects</a>.
</p>

<p>
   This "pass by pointer" method works for struct types, not
   just basic types like "int".  That's important, because
   many Windows APIs use the same pattern with structs.
   So next up, let's look at how to define native struct types
   in Javascript.
</p>

<h2>HANDLE and HWND variables as "out" parameters</h2>

<p>
   Some Windows APIs return handle values as "out" parameters rather than
   as the function return value.  In such a situation, the API will take
   a HANDLE* or HWND* pointer as an argument, with the intention that
   the caller will pass in the address of a HANDLE variable, where the
   callee will store the requested handle value before returning.
</p>
<p>
   You can code these calls same way as other "out" parameter calls:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>First, create a Javascript variable containing an empty HANDLE or
   HWND object, using "new" to create the appropriate empty handle type
   <li>Then pass that variable in the argument slot where the
   HANDLE* or HWND* is required.  Javascript will automatically pass
   the address of the HANDLE object's internal native handle element
   to the native API, which will allow the API to store the return
   value at the appropriate memory location.
   <li>After the function returns,
   the Javascript HANDLE/HWND object will contain the native handle
   value stored by the function.
</ul>
<p>
   For example, the OpenThreadToken() API returns a thread token as
   a HANDLE value in its fourth argument, which is specified in the
   API as a HANDLE* "out" variable.  Here's how you can call the
   function to obtain the token handle.
</p>
<div class="code">
// create an empty HANDLE object to receive the token handle
let hToken = new HANDLE();

// ask Windows for the token handle
if (Advapi32.OpenThreadToken(Advapi32.GetCurrentThread(), TOKEN_QUERY, 1, hToken)) {
    // Success - hToken now contains the thread token
}
</div>

<p>
   You can use the same technique when an HWND* out parameter is used.  In
   that case, use <tt>new HWND()</tt> to create the empty window handle object
   that will hold the result.
</p>
   

<a name="dllImportDefine"></a>
<h2>Defining C struct types</h2>
<p>
   Many Windows API functions use C "struct" (structure) types as
   arguments (or, more commonly, pointers to struct types).
   For example, the GetWindowRect() API function takes
   a pointer to a RECT structure, which has elements for the
   corner coordinates of a rectangle:
</p>
<div class="code">
let User32 = dllImport.bind("User32.dll", "BOOL WINAPI GetWindowRect(HWND, struct RECT *)");
</div>

<p>
   If you just run that bind() call without doing any preparation
   first, it'll fail with an error, because "struct RECT" isn't
   a built-in type.  You have to define it before you can use it
   in a function definition.
</p>
<p>
   There is, naturally, a dllImport() call to do this: define().
   As with the function declaration itself, you use the
   standard C syntax for declaring a struct type:
</p>
<div class="code">
dllImport.define("struct RECT { LONG left; LONG top; LONG right; LONG bottom; }");
</div>

<p>
   The define() method doesn't return anything.  It just parses the
   type definition and adds it to an internal table of type names
   inside the dllImport object.  Once the type is entered into the
   internal table, you can use it in subsequent bind() calls.
</p>

<p>
   The define() call above uses <i>almost</i> the same syntax that Windows
   SDK documentation uses for RECT.
   But they actually take this one step further, by defining a couple
   of "typedef" types for the structure.  typedef is a C language
   feauture that creates a global alias for a type.  It simply adds a
   new global name for the type that you can use in other places, such as
   in function declarations.  Here's a revision to the above, using the
   full typedef that the SDK uses:
</p>
<div class="code">
dllImport.define("typedef struct _RECT { LONG left; LONG top; LONG right; LONG bottom; } RECT, *PRECT");
</div>

<p>
   You'll see that naming pattern throughout the Windows SDK headers: "typedef struct _FOO { ... } FOO, *PFOO".
   That actually defines <i>three</i> related types:
   the struct name itself, with an underscore prefix on the name (<b>struct _FOO</b>),
   a global alias with the plain name (<b>FOO</b>), and a global "pointer" alias
   with the "P" prefix (<b>PFOO</b>).  There's almost always a fourth alias as well, <b>LPFOO</b>.
   The "LP" prefix stands for "long pointer".  Long pointers are holdovers from the
   16-bit Windows 3 era - they're exactly the same as regular pointers now - but the
   Windows headers still use them everywhere.  So let's add the "LP" to our typedef
   to make it complete:
</p>
<div class="code">
dllImport.define("typedef struct _RECT { LONG left; LONG top; LONG right; LONG bottom; } RECT, *PRECT, *LPRECT");
</div>
<p>
   So there you have it: that's the form of the typedef you'll need to enter for virtually every struct
   you'll need in a Windows API call.  With this definition in place, the bind()
   call for GetWindowRect() that we showed earlier will finally work properly.
</p>

<p><b>Using back-quote strings:</b>
   For long struct definitions, you might prefer to use Javascript's
   "back-quote string" style, which lets you spread out a string across multiple lines of
   text.  That lets you paste a multi-line struct from the SDK without having to compress
   it into one line, which makes the result a lot more readable.
</p>
<div class="code">
dllImport.define(`
typedef struct _STARTUPINFOW {
  DWORD  cb;
  LPWSTR lpReserved;
  LPWSTR lpDesktop;
  LPWSTR lpTitle;
  DWORD  dwX;
  DWORD  dwY;
  DWORD  dwXSize;
  DWORD  dwYSize;
  DWORD  dwXCountChars;
  DWORD  dwYCountChars;
  DWORD  dwFillAttribute;
  DWORD  dwFlags;
  WORD   wShowWindow;
  WORD   cbReserved2;
  LPBYTE lpReserved2;
  HANDLE hStdInput;
  HANDLE hStdOutput;
  HANDLE hStdError;
} STARTUPINFOW, *LPSTARTUPINFOW;
`);
</div>

<h2>Using structs as "out" parameters</h2>

<p>
   As mentioned above in <a href="#outParams">Out parameters</a>,
   many Windows API functions take pointers to structs as parameters,
   so that they can return information to the caller by writing into
   the struct.
</p>
<p>
   Whenever a DLL function requires a struct or a pointer to a
   struct as a parameter, you can directly pass a Javascript object
   as the argument, and the DLL importer will create a temporary
   copy of the native struct from the Javascript object's properties.
   This is described below under <a href="#typeConversion">Automatic
   type conversions</a>.  However, this is a purely one-way
   process: you can pass information <i>to</i> a DLL function
   this way, but you can't get any information back from the
   function.  The reason is that the DLL function doesn't get
   a direct reference to your Javascript object - it just gets
   that <i>temporary copy</i> of the native struct that the
   DLL importer creates.  Anything that the DLL function writes
   into the struct go into the <i>temporary</i> struct, which
   is lost after the function returns.
</p>
<p>
   The solution is exactly the same as the solution described
   earlier for simple types like "int pointer" parameters.  You
   use dllImport.create() to explicitly create your own copy
   of the native struct, and you pass that struct to the DLL
   function.
</p>

<div class="code">
let rc = dllImport.create("RECT");
User32.GetWindowRect(hwnd, rc);
</div>

<p>
   As with our earlier example of creating a native "int" variable,
   the RECT struct that we created here is represented as a Javascript
   object that contains the native data structure.  You can access the
   struct's named field as though they were Javascript properties of
   the object:
</p>
<div class="code">
alert("The window is at (" + rc.left + ", " + rc.top" +
    "), (" + rc.right + ", " + rc.bottom + ")");
</div>

<p>
   Note that there's no .value property of a struct type, as there
   is for a basic type like "int".  Instead, you use the named
   struct elements.
</p>

<h2>Native pointer types</h2>

<p>
   Structs often contain pointer types.  If you encounter one
   of these, you can access pointer fields just like anything
   else.  The type system will give you a Javascript object
   representing the native pointer contained in the field.
   To access the struct or basic type value that the pointer
   points to, use the .at property:
</p>
<div class="code">
let x = p.at;   // x now accesses the native object that p points to
</div>

<p>
   You can also explicitly create a native pointer variable,
   just like any other native type:
</p>
<div class="code">
let p = dllImport.create("int*");
</div>

<p>
   When you first create a pointer type, it will be initialized with
   a null pointer, so attempting to get the underlying value with .at
   will throw an error.  You can assign another pointer value to it by
   setting its value:
</p>
<div class="code">
p.value = otherPointer.value;  // assign the value from some other native pointer
</div>

<p>
   You can get the address of a native object for storing in
   a native pointer variable using the NativeObject.addressOf()
   function:
</p>
<div class="code">
let i = dllImport.create("int");
p.value = NativeObject.addressOf(i);
</div>

<p>
   To protect against memory corruption and application crashes,
   you can only assign a pointer value from a pointer to the same
   type.  The one exception is the special "void" pointer ("void*"),
   which C uses as a generic pointer to anything.  In keeping with
   C's general philosophy that it should give you enough rope to hang yourself,
   the native "void*" type relaxes the normal type restrictions and
   lets you assign unlike pointer types.  This goes both directions;
   you can assign anything to a void* pointer, and you can assign
   any other pointer type from a void* pointer.  So in special
   situations when the normal type rules are too restrictive,
   you can say "I know what I'm doing here, just do as I say" by
   laundering your pointers through
   a void* intermediary.  If none of this makes any sense
   to you, it's probably just as well; it's usually better to
   avoid this sort of thing anyway.

<h2>Native object memory management</h2>

<p>
   If you've done any programming in C or C++, you know that those
   languages require you to do all of your memory management
   explicitly: you have write code to create and destroy every
   object you use.  Javascript, in contrast, handles most of
   that automatically.
</p>
<p>
   The DLL import approach to managing native objects is somewhere
   between the low-level details of C/C++ and the completely
   automatic, invisible garbage collection in Javascript.
</p>
<p>
   <b>When you create a native object with dllImport.create(),</b>
   you're really creating two objects: a Javascript
   NativeObject object, and a block of memory containing
   the native type named in the create() call.  The Javascript
   object is managed automatically, just like any other
   Javascript object.  The native memory block is also
   managed automatically: it will remain valid as long as
   there are any references to it from Javascript objects.
   So you don't have to do any special manual memory
   management for objects you create with dllImport.create().
</p>
<p>
   If you pass an object you create with dllImport.create()
   to native code in a DLL, be sure that you understand how
   the native callee will use that memory.  In particular,
   pay attention to whether or not the callee expects the
   memory to stay valid after the call returns.  If the
   callee retains the pointer and expects it to remain valid,
   you'll have to ensure that the Javascript NativeObject that
   refers to the native memory stays "alive", so that
   Javascript's garbage collector doesn't delete it.
   Remember, the native memory underlying a NativeObject
   that you create with dllImport.create() stays valid
   as long as its NativeObject stays alive.  To keep a
   Javascript object alive, all you have to do is reference
   it from a global variable.
</p>
<p>
   <b>When you get a NativeObject from a DLL call</b> - for example,
   if a DLL function returns a pointer to a struct - the
   NativeObject is managed automatically like any other
   Javascript object.  However, the underlying native memory
   is under the control of the native DLL code.  This has
   some important implications.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>First, Javascript can't delete externally allocated
   native memory when it's no longer usable, because Javascript
   has no way of knowing how the DLL might be using the memory.
   Depending on the design of the DLL or API you're using, you
   might be required to make a special call into the DLL to
   manually delete the object when you're done with it.
   You'll have to read the documentation for the DLL or API
   you're using to find out if there's any special "delete" or
   "free" call you're supposed to make when you're done with
   the object.  Failing to make those calls when you're expected
   to can lead to "memory leaks", where the memory that an
   object takes up can't be re-used because you never tell
   the system that you're done with it.  If you repeatedly
   allocate objects without ever freeing any of them, they
   unused objects will eventually take up all of memory and
   the program will crash.

   <li>Second, for the same reason that Javascript can't
   automatically delete the object when you're done with it,
   Javascript also can't <i>prevent</i> the native object
   from being deleted before you're done with it.  There's
   a common source of bugs in C/C++ programming known as
   "dangling pointers", where you delete an object before
   you're done using it, so any pointers to that object are
   now pointing to invalid memory.  That type of error is
   normally impossible in Javascript, but it can happen
   with a NativeObject that comes from external native
   code, because the external code might delete the object
   without Javascript's permission or knowledge.  Again, you'll
   have to check your DLL or API documentation to determine
   the lifetime of any memory allocations that come from the
   DLL side.
</ul>

<h2>Argument type conversions</h2>
<p>
   When you pass arguments from Javascript to a DLL function, the
   DLL importer automatically converts the Javascript values to the
   native types listed in the function declaration.  Here's a summary
   of the conversion rules.

            that the pointer refers to (e.g., the parameter is
            an INT32*, and the native object value is an INT32),
            a pointer to the native value in memory is passed.

<p>
   <b>Standard type conversions:</b>
   The "standard implicit type conversions" mentioned several times
   in the list above are the ones that Javascript normally performs
   when type conversions are called for when working entirely in the
   Javascript domain.  For example, using any type of value in a
   Javascript arithmetic expression implicitly converts the value to
   a Number.  You can find more about the standard conversion rules
   in any Javascript language reference.
</p>
<p>
   In addition to the standard conversions, the DLL importer also
   converts any <a href="Int64.html">Int64 or Uint64</a> value to
   a Number as part of any of the conversions listed above that
   implicitly convert to Number at any point.  In this case, an
   error is thrown if the 64-bit integer value is outside of
   the range that can be exactly represented in a Javascript
   Number (-9007199254740991 to +9007199254740991).
</p>


<p>
   <b>Objects:</b>  As described in the table, a Javascript
   object can be passed to a native callee when a struct pointer
   is required.  This is accomplished by creating a temporary
   copy of the native struct, populating it from the Javascript
   object's properties, and passing the callee a pointer to the
   temporary struct.
</p>
<p>
   Note that this is a strictly one-way
   data transfer, because of the temporary nature of the
   struct passed to the native callee.  Any changes that the
   callee makes to the struct are lost on return, since the
   temporary struct is deleted after the native code returns.
   If you need to receive information
   back from the native function through the struct, you must
   explicitly create your own copy of the native struct using
   dllImport.create(), and pass that to the DLL function.
   See <a href="#outParams">Out parameters</a>.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Strings:</b>  The DLL importer has some special provisions
   for string handling.  See <a href="#strings">below</a> for
   details.
</p>

<p>
   <b>More details on ArrayBuffer:</b>  The Javascript ArrayBuffer type lets you
   create a native byte array and manipulate it from Javascript.
   It's an excellent "type of last resort" for special
   cases that the DLL Import system can't handle with its automatic
   type conversions.  You can pass an ArrayBuffer object for any
   native function argument that requires a pointer to any type.
   The DLL import layer will pass the underlying memory pointer
   directly to the native code.  It's up to you to prepare the
   bytes contained in the ArrayBuffer in the appropriate format
   for the callee before the call, and/or to interpret the
   results left in the buffer on return.  If the callee will
   write into the buffer, it's up to you to make sure that the
   buffer is large enough for what the callee expects.
</p>
<p>
   ArrayBuffer should only be used when you can't use something
   more structured, like a native type created with dllImport.create()
   (see <a href="#outParams">Out parameters</a>) or via one of
   the automatic conversions listed above.
   You can use ArrayBuffer in cases where it's not
   possible (or not convenient) to express the type of the
   function argument as a C struct type.  For most Windows
   APIs, this isn't a concern, as the Windows APIs are
   designed around C callers to start with.  But other DLLs
   might have different data formats that don't translate
   well to C terms.

<h2>Strings</h2>
<p>
   Javascript makes it easy to work with character strings.  A
   String in Javascript is a first-class object that you can
   operate on as a unit, without having to worry about the details
   of how the text inside is actually stored.  C code and machine
   code aren't nearly as high-level.  To them, a string is just an
   array of bytes (or 16-bit integers, in the case of a Unicode)
   string).  The Windows DLL conventions are all designed around
   the C way of doing things, so DLL interfaces think in terms
   of those low-level "character array" strings used in C rather
   than the high-level "objects" in Javascript.
</p>
<p>
   The DLL importer tries to smooth over this mismatch for you
   by converting automatically between the two views of strings
   whenever possible.  Here's a summary of the type conversions
   that the DLL importer applies.

   <b>Convenience functions for Int8Array, Uint8Array, Int16Array, and Uint16Array:</b>
   The PinballY system scripts provide you with some extra functions
   to make it easier to use these array types to transfer strings
   to and from DLL functions.
</p>
<p>
   You can generally pass Javascript strings directly to any
   native function that requires a pointer to a string or string
   buffer, but that's only good for getting a string <i>to</i> a
   DLL function.  Many native DLL functions return string values
   by storing them in buffers you provide.  For that, you need
   Int8Array, Uint8Array, Int16Array, or Uint16Array, since these
   provide the buffers that the native code needs, and let you
   retrieve the results in Javascript.
</p>
<p>
   The only snag is that typed arrays don't act
   like ordinary strings in Javascript.  So these types
   are great for getting data back from DLL functions, but
   once you have data back in one of these objects, you'll
   usually want to convert it to a Javascript string.  Similarly,
   you might need to create one of the array objects from a
   string.  The convenience functions let you do these
   conversions in one step.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Int8Array, Uint8Array.fromString(<i>string</i>, <i>length</i>):</b>
   Returns an Int8Array or Uint8Array containing the characters of the
   given string expressed as 8-bit character code values.  You
   can optionally specify the length of the result buffer, which can
   be useful when you need to create a buffer for a callee to return
   a string value into.  This value can be used in a DLL call anywhere
   that the native function requires a pointer to an 8-bit character
   string, or a buffer for an 8-bit character string.

   <li><b>Int16Array, Uint16Array.fromString(<i>string</i>, <i>length</i>):</b>
   Returns an array containing the characters of the given string
   expressed as 16-bit Unicode code values.
   The optional length lets you specify the size of the buffer.
   You can pass this to a native function anywhere that a Unicode
   string pointer or string buffer pointer is required.

   <li><b><i>Int8ArrayValue</i>, <i>Uint8ArrayValue</i>.toString():</b>  Converts the
   array back to a Javscript string.  If the string is null-terminated,
   the resulting Javascript string ends at the null character.  You
   can use this to retrieve a string returned in the array from a
   DLL callee.
   
   <li><b><i>Int8ArrayValue</i>, <i>Uint8ArrayValue</i>.toStringRaw(<i>length</i>):</b>
   Converts the array back to a Javscript string, treating the
   8-bit integers as Unicode character values, and <i>ignoring</i>
   any null terminator.  Every byte of the array is included in the
   Javascript string, up to the optional length limit.
   (If no length is specified, the whole array is converted.)
   You can use this if the callee returns the length of the
   string as a separate result, rather than using null termination.
   
   <li><b><i>Int16ArrayValue</i>, <i>Uint16ArrayValue</i>.toString(<i>length</i>):</b>  Converts the
   array back to a Javscript string.  If the string is null-terminated,
   the resulting Javascript string ends at the null character.

   <li><b><i>Int16ArrayValue</i>, <i>Uint16ArrayValue</i>.toStringRaw(<i>length</i>):</b>
   Converts the array back to a Javscript string, treating the 16-bit
   integer values as Unicode characters, and <i>ignoring</i>
   any null terminator.  Every character of the array is included in the
   Javascript string, up to the optional length limit.
   (If no length is specified, the whole array is converted.)
   You can use this if the callee returns the length of the
   string as a separate result, rather than using null termination.
   
</ul>
   
<p>
   <b>Native string handling concepts:</b>
   If you're not familiar with the way that C and native DLLs
   handle strings, some of the key concepts are described below.
   These might be helpful to understand if you run into any
   weird situations that the summary above doesn't explain
   properly.
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>Null-terminated strings:</b>  This is the most common way
   to represent a string in C and in the Windows API functions.
   A C string is just an array of characters, with the end of
   the string marked by a "null" character, meaning a character
   with ASCII or Unicode value 0.  (This isn't the character "0",
   which has Unicode code value 48.  A null is a special character
   with code value 0.  It doesn't correspond to any printed character.)
   Native code figures out the length of the string by scanning
   through the characters of a string until it reaches the null.
   <p>
      Almost all Windows API functions use this representation
      for string arguments and string return values.  Most other
      native DLL functions do the same thing, since it's the
      almost universal convention for code written in the C
      language.
   </p>

   <li><b>Strings vs character arrays:</b>  In C, there's no real
   distinction between a string and an array of characters.  Any
   DLL function that takes or returns a string will actually take
   a pointer to a character array, also called a character buffer.
   It's up to the caller and callee to agree that the array of
   characters will be treated as a string.  The biggest thing
   they usually have to agree about is how to determine the
   length of the string - and in most cases, the answer is
   null termination, as described above.
   <p>
      The term "string buffer" is often used instead of "character
      array".  A buffer is just a block of memory.  In C, that's
      all an array is, too, so "buffer" and "array" are pretty much
      interchangeable terms when we're talking about C code or
      DLL interfaces.
   </p>
   
   <li><a name="lpstr"></a>
   <b>LPSTR, LPCSTR...:</b>  If you're calling Windows API
   functions, you'll find that most APIs that take or return
   string values use a type named LPSTR, LPCSTR, or a something
   similar.  These aren't actually "built-in" C types; they're just
   type aliases defined in the Windows SDK headers as "pointer
   to character".  But they <i>are</i> built in to the DLL
   importer's type parser, so you can freely use them anywhere
   a string is being passed or returned.

   <p>The point of these aliases is to make it
      explicit that a <b>string</b> value is expected, not just
      any "pointer to character" value.  Even though the C language
      doesn't have a concept of "string" vs "character pointer",
      the Windows SDK definitions still want to make that distinction
      for the sake of a human reading the function definition, so
      they use these type aliases for that purpose.  The DLL
      importer also uses them to recognize when strings are
      being passed between Javascript and native code.
   </p>
   <p>
      All of the LPSTR-related types specifically refer to
      null-terminated strings (see above).  Callees expect that
      a string passed in is null-terminated, and any strings
      returned will be null-terminated.
   </p>
   <p>
      The "C" types (LPCSTR, LPCTSTR, LPCWSTR) are <b>constant</b>
      strings, meaning that the caller promises not to change any
      of the characters in the buffer.  These are used for strings
      that are just to pass information to the callee.  If the "C"
      isn't there, the callee might change the contents of the buffer,
      so the non-"C" type is used when the callee wants to return
      information in the string buffer.  Calls where the callee
      returns information usually also have a "buffer length"
      argument that tells the caller the maximum number of
      characters it can safely store in the buffer.
   </p>
   <p>
      The "T" types (LPTSTR, LPCTSTR) are "Current Type" strings,
      meaning that they could be old-fashioned single-byte strings
      <i>or</i> Unicode strings, depending on how the current program
      is compiled.  <b>In PinballY, the "T" types are <i>always</i>
      Unicode strings,</b> so they're always equivalent to the W types.
      (The point of the "T" types is to allow older code to be compiled
      in either Unicode mode or single-byte mode.  They're
      widely used in the Windows APIs to make it easy for developers
      to switch modes without having to change a lot of code.  PinballY
      is always built in Unicode mode, so T and W types are identical
      when working with the DLL importer.)
   </p>
   <p>
     Here's the full set of LPSTR-related types, and what
     they all mean:

<h2>Typed Arrays</h2>
<p>
   Javascript typed arrays can be used any time a native interface calls
   for an array of or pointer to the corresponding native type.
</p>
<p>
   A typed array argument must always exactly match the native type
   declared for the function parameter.  The correspondences between
   native types and Javascript typed array types are listed
   below.
</p>
<p>
   C pointers and arrays are closely related, and can be used interchangeably
   in function arguments.  For the sake of brevity, we only list pointer types
   in the table, using the C "*" pointer notation, but you can use the same
   Javascript array types with C array arguments of the corresponding types.
   For example, when we list <b>unsigned short *p</b> in the table, you can
   also use the same typed array type with an <b>unsigned short[]</b> or
   <b>unsigned short p[<i>size</i>]</b> function parameter.

<h2>Getting the size of a native type</h2>
<p>
   When calling native DLL functions, you'll sometimes need to determine
   the size of a native type in order to pass the right parameters to the
   function.  The dllImport object has a <b>sizeof()</b> method that helps
   with this.
</p>
<p>
   To determine the size of a type, call <b>dllImport.sizeof("<i>typename</i>")</b>,
   where <i>typename</i> is the name of the native type whose size you want
   to obtain.  The type name uses the same C/C++ syntax as used in
   dllImport.define() and dllImport.bind().  It can be the name of a basic
   primitive C type (char, short, int, long, etc), the name of one of the
   Windows object types (HANDLE,  HWND), or the name of a struct, union,
   or typedef previously defined with dllImport.define().
</p>
<p>
   The return value is an integer giving the number of bytes the type
   uses on the current platform.  Note that some types are different
   sizes on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows platforms.
<p>
   Examples:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>dllImport.sizeof("int") returns the size of the native C/C++ "int" type

   <li>dllImport.sizeof("struct foo") returns the size of a struct named "foo"
   previously defined with dllImport.define()
</ul>

<h3>Auto "cbSize" struct elements</h3>
<p>
   It's very common in the Windows API for
   structs passed as arguments to include a member named <b>cbSize</b> that
   indicates the size (in bytes) of the struct in memory.  Many Windows APIs use
   this as a sort of sanity check that the caller is passing in a valid memory
   pointer, and sometimes to detect which version of a struct definition the
   caller is using.  When a cbSize element is present, the caller almost always
   has to initialize it before using the struct in an API call; most Windows
   API calls that involve a struct with a cbSize field will return an error if
   cbSize isn't filled in properly.
</p>
<p>
   This is such a common convention in the Windows APIs that the DLL importer
   has special handling for it.  Whenever you call a DLL function that takes
   a struct (or a pointer to a struct) as an argument, the DLL importer will
   automatically fill in the struct's cbSize field with the size of the
   containing struct, if all of the following are true:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The member name in the native "struct" definition is exactly <b>cbSize</b>
   <li>That member in the native struct has some kind of integer type (short, int, unsigned long, size_t, etc)
   <li>The Javascript object passed in for that argument <b>doesn't</b> have a cbSize property
</ul>
<p>
   If all of those conditions are true, the DLL importer will automatically
   fill in cbSize in the native struct with the byte size of the native struct.
   You can easily override this automatic behavior, in case it doesn't do what
   you want for a particular function, by either changing the name of the
   native struct element to anything other than "cbSize", or by passing in
   a value explicitly for the cbSize property in the Javascript object used
   for the struct argument.
</p>

<h2>Windows HANDLE objects</h2>

<p>
   Many API calls in Windows work with HANDLE objects of one type or another:
   window handles, bitmap handles, etc.  These are so widely used that the DLL
   importer treats handles as a special type.  Type names for most of the
   standard Windows handle types are pre-defined, and you can always create
   new ones with a typedef:
</p>
<div class="code">
dllImport.define("typedef HANDLE HWHATEVER");
</div>
<p>
   When a HANDLE value is returned from a native function, the importer
   gives you a special native-code Javascript object to represent the handle
   value.  You can then pass this object back to any DLL call that takes
   a handle value as a parameter.
</p>
<p>
   The reason the importer uses the special native-code object is that
   HANDLE types are basically native pointers, which are 64-bit values
   on 64-bit Windows versions.  Javascript doesn't have a primitive
   type that can represent this properly.  Its closest approximation is
   the Number type, which actually does use 64 bits, but those bits have
   to be formatted in a certain way (specifically, in the double-precision
   floating point format).  The native-code HANDLE object ensures that
   the system handle value is stored properly.
</p>
<p>
   See <a href="HandleObject.html">HANDLE objects</a> for more details.

      

<h2>Callback functions</h2>
<p>
   Many Windows APIs take "callback" function parameters.  A callback
   is simply a caller-provided function that the API calls back into (thus
   the name) during the API operation.  This is most often used for
   enumeration functions that call the callback once for each item in a
   collection, such as child windows of a given window.
</p>
<div class="code">
// C++ example - typical C++ code to get a list of child windows
static BOOL CALLBACK my_callback_function(HWND hwndChild, LPARAM lParam)
{
    // recover 'this' from the lParam
    MyClass *self = reinterpret_cast&lt;MyClass*&gt;(lParam);
    
    // do something with the child window handle...
    self->process_child(hwndChild);
}

void MyClass::my_calling_function(HWND hwndParent)
{
    EnumChildWindows(hwndParent, &amp;my_callback_function, reinterpret_cast&lt;LPARAM&gt;(this));
}
</div>

<p>
   This concept is hardly foreign to Javascript.  In fact, it's
   so widely used by Javascript built-ins and frameworks that some
   people think Javascript invented it!  You see this
   coding style used in the built-in Javascript array type,
   for example:
</p>
<div class="code">
var array1 = [1, 15, 32, 17, 18, 19, 12];

function isEven(x)
{
    return x/2 == 0;
}
var evens = array1.filter(isEven);                           // named function
var odds = array1.filter(function(x) { return x/2 != 0; });  // anonymous function
var doubled = array1.map(x => x*2);                          // "arrow" function
</div>

<p>
   Callbacks in Javascript are usually written with anonymous
   functions (a/k/a closures or lambdas), as in the last two
   examples above.  C/C++ callbacks usually use named functions,
   as in the first example (although modern C++ also allows syntax
   similar to Javascript closures).  All of these formats
   are just syntactic variations, though; they all have the
   same effect of providing a function reference to the called
   function, which calls it back to carry out some work.
</p>

<p>
   The DLL importer makes it easy to use callbacks when required in
   native APIs.  You just use the standard C syntax to define the
   API function that takes a function pointer parameter, then you
   call it with a Javascript function for the function pointer
   argument.  You can use named functions or closures (lambdas/anonymous
   functions).
</p>
<div class="code">
dllImport.define("typedef BOOL (CALLBACK *WNDENUMPROC)(HWND hwnd, LPARAM lParam)");
let EnumWindows = dllImport.bind("User32.dll", "BOOL WINAPI EnumWindows(WNDENUMPROC lpEnumFunc, LPARAM lParam)");

// make an array of all top-level window handles
let windows = [];
EnumWindows((hwnd) => windows.push(hwnd), 0);
</div>

<p>
   The DLL importer provides the necessary plumbing that turns
   the Javascript function reference into a native function
   pointer that the native code in the DLL can call directly.
   That in turn invokes your Javascript function.  As when
   calling from Javascript into DLL native code, the DLL
   importer automatically converts argument values when
   calling back from the DLL into Javascript, so your
   function works just like it would if it were being
   called directly from Javascript code.
</p>

<p><b>LPARAM and LPVOID "context" pointers:</b>
   Almost every Windows API that takes a callback function pointer
   argument has an additional LPARAM or LPVOID parameter at the end.
   The Windows headers usually give this parameter the uninformative
   name "lParam", so you have to read the documentation to figure out that
   its purpose is just to let you pass some extra information
   to your own callback function.  Why would you need that?  Because
   it lets you use the same callback function in different places
   in the code.  The extra information in the LPARAM or LPVOID
   parameter tells you the current context in which it's being
   invoked.  In fact, these parameters are usually called "context"
   arguments.
</p>
<p>
   You see context arguments all the time in C callback code,
   but you rarely see them in Javascript.  The reason is that
   Javascript functions have their own sort of built-in context,
   because a Javascript anonymous function can access all of the
   local variables in its enclosing scope.  That's handled behind
   the scenes by the Javascript engine, so it happens without any
   special coding on your part.  
</p>
<p>
   When you pass a Javascript function to a native DLL call, the
   Javascript function has access to all of its local variable
   context, exactly as normal.  That makes it unnecessary to
   pass anything at all for the LPARAM or LPVOID parameter to
   a Windows API that will call the Javascript callback.  You
   can just pass 0 for these arguments.  But if you do need to
   use the context argument for some reason, you can pass any
   integer value, and it'll get passed back to your callback
   function in the corresponding LPARAM or LPVOID parameter.
</p>

<p><b>C's wacky function pointer syntax:</b>  The C syntax for
   defining a function pointer is pretty obtuse.  Fortunately,
   you can just copy and paste the definitions for most of the
   common Windows callback types from the SDK documentation, so
   you shouldn't have to become an expert at the C syntax.  For
   reference, though, here's the basic C function pointer declaration
   syntax.  It's a little bizarre, but in most cases you should be
   able to just stick to this formula:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   typedef <b><i>return-type</i> ( <i>calling-convention</i> *<i>function-name</i>
   )( <i>arguments</i> )</b>
</div>
<p>
   There actually is a somewhat more readable alternative that
   some people prefer.  The trick is to do the declaration in two
   steps.  First, you define a typedef for the type of the function
   itself.  This is easy because it looks almost exactly like a
   regular function definition, the only difference being the
   addition of the "typedef" keyword at the start.  That makes it
   a type definition instead of an actual function declaration.
   Then you define a second typedef that's just a pointer to that
   first type.  That's also easy, because it uses the ordinary
   TYPE* syntax.  Here's how we could have done that with our
   EnumWindows() callback:
</p>
<div class="code">
typedef BOOL CALLBACK WndEnumProc(HWND, LPARAM);  // step 1: define the function type
typedef WndEnumProc* WNDENUMPROC;                 // step 2: pointer to the function type
</div>


<h2>COM and OLE objects</h2>

<p>
   The DLL importer has some support from COM interfaces as well.
</p>
<p>
   The importer pre-defines for the following COM interfaces, so you
   don't have to define these on your own:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>IUnknown
</ul>
<p>
   For any other COM interfaces you wish to use, you'll have to define them, using
   the dllImport.define() function.  Unlike most of the definitions we've
   seen so far, interface definitions <i>don't</i> use standard C language
   syntax.  Instead, we use a syntax that's similar to the syntax used in
   Microsoft's IDL (Interface Definition Language) files.  The basic
   syntax is:
</p>
<div class="code">
<b>interface</b> <i>name</i> '<i>GUID</i>' : <i>baseInterface</i>
<b>{</b>
    <i>// C-style function definitions</i>
<b>};</b>
</div>

<p>
   The GUID is specified in the standard Microsoft hex format, with hyphens
   between digit groups; you can optionally use curly braces around the GUID
   (inside the quote marks), but they're just for decoration and have
   no other effect.  Every COM interface has a GUID, defined by Microsoft
   (or whoever else defined the interface).  You can't just make these up
   as they're permanent features of the interface. You can find the correct
   GUID for any standard Windows interface in the IDL file in the SDK where
   the interface is defined; look for the <b>uuid(...)</b> definition
   preceding the <b>interface</b> statement.
</p>
<p>
   The base interface is the name of a previously defined interface
   that serves as the "base class" of the interface.  With the single
   exception IUnknown (which is pre-defined by the DLL importer, so you
   don't have to define it yourself), all COM interfaces are based on
   some other interface, and IUnknown is always the ultimate base
   interface.  An interface automatically "inherits" all of the functions
   in its base interface.
<p>
   The function definitions within the interface use
   standard C syntax.
</p>
<p>
   For example, here's how you'd define the standard Windows interface IPersist:
</p>
<div class="code">
dllImport.define(`
    interface IPersist '0000010c-0000-0000-C000-000000000046' : IUnknown
    {
        HRESULT GetClassID(CLSID *pClassID);
    };`);
</div>

<p>
   The C parser also accepts the MIDL_INTERFACE syntax used in Windows
   SDK .idl files.  This makes it fairly easy to copy and paste interface
   definitions from the .idl files directly into your Javascript code,
   with little or no hand-editing, which can make it a lot faster to
   import a bunch of interfaces if you trying to get something complex
   working.
</p>
<div class="code">
dllImport.define(`
    MIDL_INTERFACE("0000010c-0000-0000-C000-000000000046")
    interface IPersist : public IUnknown
    {
    public:
        virtual HRESULT STDMETHODCALL GetClassID(CLSID *pClassID) = 0;
    };`);
</div>
<p>
   The MIDL_INTERFACE syntax is a little more verbose, since it
   adds the C++ keywords like "public", "virtual", and the "=0"
   pure-virtual qualifier.  All of these extra keywords are
   accepted, but are simply ignored, as they're all implied
   in an interface anyway. 
</p>

<p>
   Note that I like to use the back-quote (`) notation for COM
   interface definitions, because they tend to be too long to pack
   onto one line.  But of course, this isn't required; the definition
   is just a string, and you can use any string delimiters you prefer.
</p>

<p>
   As with any C function definition, you can specify a calling
   convention for each function in an interface, but it <i>must</i>
   always be STDMETHODCALLTYPE.  This is the default for all interface
   functions, so you can safely omit it, and it's an error to specify
   any other convention.
</p>
<p>
   The order of the functions listed in an interface definition is
   critical.  It must exactly match the definition in the IDL file
   in the Microsoft SDK where the interface is officially defined.
   A live COM object instance is essentially an array of function
   pointers, so the only way that Javascript knows which function you
   want to call is by matching its position in the interface definition
   to the position in the pointer array.  The caller and the object
   have to agree on the order of the functions, which all contained
   in the IDL layout.
</p>

<p>
   <b>Pointers to interfaces:</b>  Once you define an "interface" type,
   it works a lot like a "struct" or "union" type in terms of referencing
   it from other type definitions.  For example, you can create a pointer
   to an interface using syntax like this:
</p>
<div class="code">
let pUnk = dllImport.create("interface IUnknown*");
</div>
<p>
   The same syntax works for typedef statements.  It's common in the Windows SDKs
   to create the usual raft of type alias for interface pointers, which
   you can replicate with dllImport.define() using typedefs:
</p>
<div class="code">
dllImport.define("typedef interface IPersist IPersist, *LPPERSIST");
</div>

<p>
   The DLL importer has special handling for interface OUT pointers in
   function arguments.  COM interfaces that return an interface pointer
   to a caller always do so via a parameter that's defined as a
   <i>pointer to a pointer to an interface</i>, such as <b>IMoniker**</b>.
   The double asterisks mean "pointer to pointer".  This is often just
   <b>void**</b> (pointer to pointer to void) rather than a specific
   interface type.  You see the void** type used in QueryInterface,
   for example:
</p>
<div class="code">
HRESULT QueryInterface(REFIID riid, void **ppvInterface);
</div>
<p>
   Whenever a COM interface requires a pointer-to-pointer variable,
   be it a particular Interface** or a generic void**, the DLL
   importer lets you pass in a plain Interface* variable.  The
   importer automatically passes the address of your pointer
   variable in these cases, as required by the interface definition.
   This makes it easier to call functions like QueryInterface
   and CoCreateInstance, since you don't have to explicitly
   add any "AddressOf" calls.
</p>
<div class="code">
let p = dllImport.create("ITest*");
i.QueryInterface(IID_ITest, p);
</div>

<p>
   <b>IID_PPV_ARGS:</b>
   In the case of QueryInterface, there's an even quicker short-hand
   format you can use.  Whenever a function interface has a pair of
   parameters of the form <b>REFIID, Interface**</b> or
   <b>REFIID, void**</b>, you can pass an interface pointer
   for the <i>pair</i> of arguments.  So we could rewrite the
   call above like this:
</p>
<div class="code">
i.QueryInterface(p);
</div>

<p>
   We call this the IID_PPV_ARGS pattern because that's the name
   of a macro in the Windows COM headers that does basically the
   same thing in C++ code.  It stands for "interface ID, pointer
   to pointer to void arguments".  Microsoft created this macro
   because they noticed that this particular argument combination
   occurs an awful lot in COM code; people were getting tired of
   writing it out the long way every time.  In Javascript, this
   works by matching the interface pointer argument to the
   GUID argument, and then matching it again to the subsequent
   Interface** or void** argument.  This works because a
   <a href="COMPointer.html">COMPointer object</a> (the Javascript
   object type that represents a native COM interface pointer)
   knows its own interface GUID, which is what's required for
   the REFIID argument.
</p>
   

<h2>Namespaces</h2>

<p>
   The C type parser has a feature similar to C++ namespaces.  This is
   primarily intended for people writing modules that they want to share
   with other people, since it provides a way to avoid type name conflicts
   when your shared module is used together with other shared modules
   written by other people.  If each shared module defines its types
   within a namespace, and each namespace is given a sufficiently
   distinctive name, any two modules should be able to work together
   without type naming conflicts.
</p>
   
<p>
   When you define a struct or other type via dllImport.define(),
   it goes into a global name table.  That means that you can only
   define one struct type for a given name, across all scripts.
   For most Windows  SDK headers, that's fine, because the SDK takes pains
   to give everything a unique name.  If you're mixing custom DLLs from different
   sources, though, you might find that others authors aren't always so careful
   about unique naming, so you might run into conflicts, where two DLLs use
   the same struct name for different purposes.
</p>
<p>
   The easy way to work around this is to just rename one of the types.  The
   names of structs and other types aren't part of the DLL interfaces; the only
   names that are actually part of DLL interfaces are the function names.
   So you can use whatever name you like for a struct type.  It's easier
   to keep things straight if you stick to the same names used in the DLL's
   header files or documentation, of course, but there's nothing else
   compelling you to use the original names.
</p>
<p>
   A more general way to handle name conflicts is to use "namespaces".
   A namespace is essentially a prefix that's applied to each type name
   in a group.  You create a namespace using the <b>namespace</b> keyword,
   followed by an open brace.  Every symbol defined up to the next closing
   brace is part of that namespace.
</p>
<div class="code">
dll.define(`
    namespace MyDll
    {
        struct Color {
            UINT8 r;
            UINT 8 g;
            UINT8 b;
        };

        struct Brush {
            int width;
            struct Color color;
        };
    }
`);
</div>

<p>
   Each name defined within the braces of a <b>namespace</b> statement is
   implicitly prefixed with the namespace name and a "::" delimiter, so in
   the example above, <b>struct Color</b> is actually defined as
   <b>struct MyDll::Color</b>, and <b>struct Brush</b> is actually
   <b>struct MyDll::Brush</b>.  When you refer to these types in your
   Javascript code, you must use the fully qualified name, with the
   "namespace::" prefix:
</p>
<div class="code">
// create a Color struct from the MyDll namespace
let c = dllImport.create("struct MyDll::Color");
</div>
<p>
   Within a <b>namespace { }</b> section,
   whenever you <i>reference</i> a type (as opposed to defining a new type),
   the parser looks for an existing type that matches the name.  It starts
   by assuming that you're talking about the current namespace, but if no
   matching type is found there, it looks at the enclosing namespace(s).
   So in the example above, the reference to <b>struct Color</b> within the
   definition of <b>struct Brush</b> is matched to the previously defined
   <b>struct MyDll::Color</b>.  If there hadn't been a struct Brush within
   the namespace, though, the parser would have looked for a <i>global</i>
   struct Brush, defined outside of any namespace. 
   Let's elaborate the example to show how this works:
</p>

<div class="code">
dll.define(`
    struct Rect {
       int left;
       int top;
       int right;
       int bottom
    };

    namespace MyDll
    {
        struct Color {
            UINT8 r;
            UINT 8 g;
            UINT8 b;
        };

        struct Brush {
            int width;
            struct Color color;
        };

        void FillRect(struct Rect *r, struct Brush *br);
    }
`);
</div>
<p>
   In the definition of the function FillRect(),
   <b>struct Brush</b> refers to <b>struct MyDll::Brush</b>, as in the
   earlier example, since there's a struct Brush defined in the current
   namespace.  <b>struct Rect</b> refers to the global struct definition,
   though, since the MyDll namespace doesn't have its own separate
   definition of struct Rect.
</p>
<p>
   In some cases, you might want to override the implied local namespace
   reference to refer to a global name.  Suppose, for example, that you
   <i>also</i> had a global <b>struct Color</b>, in addition to the one
   defined in the MyDll namespace as in the examples.  You could explicitly
   refer to the global name by using the "::" prefix with no namespace.
</p>
<div class="code">
dll.define(`
    struct Color { ... };      // defines a global struct ::Color
    namespace MyDll
    {
        struct Color { ... };  // defines struct MyDll::Color
        void FillRect2(struct Rect *r, struct ::Color *c);  // uses the global struct
    };
`);
</div>

<p>
   Namespaces apply to struct, union, interface, enum, and typedef names.
   They don't apply to the members of any of those objects, since the members
   are already scoped to the enclosing types.  Namespaces also don't
   apply to function names, since those don't go into the internal name
   table.
</p>

<h2>Predefined type names</h2>
<p>
   The DLL importer's C parser knows about
   all of the standard C types (int, long, float, etc) and the standard Windows
   SDK aliases for the basic types (INT, UINT, DWORD, etc).  It also pre-defines
   nearly all of the Windows HANDLE subtypes (HWND, HDC, HBITMAP, etc) and the
   common null-terminated string types (LPSTR, LPCTSTR, etc).  In normal C
   code, the "T" string types (LPTSTR, LPCTSTR) can be either ANSI (8-bit
   characters) or Unicode (16-bit characters), according to compiler options,
   but in PinballY Javascript, they're always Unicode.
</p>
<p>
   For a full, up-to-the-minute list of the predefined types, refer to the
   <b>primitiveTypes</b> constant object defined in <b>Scripts\System\CParser.js</b>.
   Any types that you need but that aren't defined there can always be added in
   your script code via a call like this:
</p>
<div class="code">
dllImport.define("typedef int *ptrToInt");
</div>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<ul>
   <li>In x86 mode, only the __stdcall and __cdecl calling conventions
      are supported.  The x86 __fastcall, __thiscall,
      and __vectorcall conventions aren't supported.  (This actually
      isn't much of a limitation in practice, because DLLs almost
      universally use __stdcall, and in rare cases use __cdecl.
      The other calling conventions are practically never used in
      public APIs because they're not as standardized across compilers.
      In 64-bit code, the different calling conventions aren't a factor,
      because Microsoft standardized on a single calling convention
      for x64, thank goodness.  The Microsoft C/C++ compilers still
      accept the function declaration qualifiers for calling conventions
      in 64-bit mode, but ignore them.)

   <li>The native MMX, SSE, and SSE2 vector types aren't supported:
      __m64, __m128, __m128i, __m128d. These types can't be used as
      function parameters, return values, or struct elements.
      They're mostly for performance-critical
      graphics code and cryptocurrency mining, so it would largely
      defeat the purpose to convert them back and forth between
      native and Javascript types.
      If you need to use these types in Javascript-adjacent code,
      it's better to write native code that works with the
      vector types directly, and write a higher level interface
      that you expose to Javascript through a custom DLL.

   <li>Because the Javascript engine is single-threaded, you
      must not attempt to call back into Javascript from code in
      any background threads you create in native code.
      For example, never use a Javscript callback as the thread
      entrypoint in a call to the Windows CreateThread() API.
   
</ul>



<h2>Working around limitations</h2>

<p>
   The native call mechanism has limitations in what it can do
   by way of type conversions, since Javascript was never designed to
   interface directly to native code.  Some Windows APIs or other
   program APIs might be impossible, or just too cumbersome,
   to call directly through the Javascript interface.  In such cases,
   you can still call the API functions; you'll just have to do it
   a little less directly.  There are a couple of approaches.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Approach 1:  Use ArrayBuffer.</b>  If the obstacle to calling
   a particular API is that the API requires a data structure or
   format that you can't represent through the DLL importer
   type conversion mechanisms, you can manually pack or unpack
   the data structure using Javascript's standard ArrayBuffer type.
   ArrayBuffer is specifically designed to let you manipulate the
   bytes in a data structure directly, so you can use it to create
   or interpret any data format that a callee uses.  You can use
   an ArrayBuffer as a parameter anywhere that a native function
   expects a native pointer type; the DLL importer passes the callee
   a direct pointer to the ArrayBuffer's underlying byte array.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Approach 2: Write a custom interface DLL.</b>  The DLL
   importer mechanism's main goal is to let you call Windows
   APIs directly, but you can just as well use it to call your
   own custom DLLs.  If a Windows API or other API that
   you're trying to use doesn't mesh well with
   the DLL importer type scheme, you can create your own
   C++ or C# DLL that calls the underlying API you're trying
   to use, and then call <i>your</i> DLL from Javascript.
   Your DLL can reformat parameters to/from the Windows API
   in a way that makes it usable through the DLL importer
   type system.  Likewise, if there's any other work that's
   cumbersome or impossible to do in Javascript, you can
   offload that part of the work to your custom DLL.
</p>
<p>
   This is similar to what you might have to do to write a
   "plug-in" for other programs.  The big difference is that you
   don't have to conform to any pre-defined plug-in protocol.
   You just define whatever particular set of functions you
   need to carry out the API operations you want to perform.
   You can still do <i>most</i> of the work in Javascript;
   the DLL is only needed to do whatever twitchy memory buffer
   setup or interpretation you need to do that can't be
   expressed through the DLL importer's type system.
