<h1>Custom Drawing</h1>

<p>
   Some features in PinballY let you do your own custom drawing from
   Javascript code.  This lets you create a custom mix of text and
   graphics with the precise pixel layout you want.  Custom drawing
   can be used in the following places:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="Popups.html">Popups</a> - message boxes displayed in
   the main window.  To do custom drawing in a popup box, provide a
   custom drawing function in the <b>draw()</b> property of the parameter
   object when you call the <a href="MainWindowObject.html#showPopup">mainWindow.showPopup</a> method.
   The system will call your custom drawing function as part of the
   showPopup() processing.

   <li><a href="DrawingLayer.html">Drawing layers</a> - custom graphics
   layers that you can create in any of the windows through scripting code.
   You can create a drawing layer via the
   <a href="WindowObjects.html">createDrawingLayer()</a> method on any
   of the system window objects (mainWindow, backglassWindow, etc).
   That method returns an object representing the new drawing layer,
   which you can draw custom graphics into using its
   <a href="DrawingLayer.html#draw">draw()</a> method.
   
   <li><a href="MainWindowObject.html#launchOverlay">Launch overlays</a> -
   the graphics layers shown during a game launch to provide status
   updates on the progress of the launch.  The system lets you access
   these layers through objects that you can get through the <b>fg</b>
   and <b>bg</b> properties of
   <a href="MainWindowObject.html#launchOverlay">mainWindow.launchOverlay</a>.
   To display custom graphics in  these layers, call the
   <a href="DrawingLayer.html#draw">draw()</a> method on the launch overlay
   layer object, passing a reference to your custom drawing function as the argument.
</ul>
   
<h2>Creating a custom drawing function</h2>

<p>
   The procedure to carry out custom drawing is a little indirect.  You
   can't just execute drawing primitives like "draw a rectangle" from anywhere
   in Javascript code.  Instead, all of your custom drawing code has to be contained
   within a "custom drawing function".  This is just an ordinary Javascript
   function, with the following signature:
</p>
<div class="code">
function myDrawingFunction(dc)
{
    // carry out the drawing primitives here
}
</div>
<p>
   The name of the function is arbitrary - you can call it anything you
   want, and you can create as many different drawing functions as you
   want, all with different names.  What's important is that it's a
   function that takes one parameter, which we've called <b>dc</b>
   here for "drawing context".  The parameter name (like the function
   name) is up to you, though - you can call it anything you want.
</p>
<p>
   The <b>dc</b> or <b>drawing context</b> argument is a special system
   object that the system creates and passes to your drawing function
   when it invokes the function.  The drawing context contains the
   system methods that let you carry out the actual graphic operations,
   such as drawing rectangles, text, and images.  This object is only
   valid for the duration of the function call to the drawing function,
   so you shouldn't store it in a global variable or otherwise hang
   onto it.  Treat it as a temporary object that exists for the
   duration of the function call only.
</p>

<p>
   The system calls this function after setting up the graphics
   area for the drawing.  The argument to the function is a "drawing
   context" object, which has methods that let you draw text and
   graphics into the popup area.
</p>

<h2>Return value from the drawing function</h2>
<p>
   The return value from the drawing function depends on the context
   where you're using the function:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>For popups, the return value indicates the desired height in
   pixels for the popup.  This is only needed if you create the
   popup with an indeterminate height.  Using an indeterminate height
   allows you to precisely size the overall popup according to the
   actual contents, by measuring the sizes of the items you draw
   within the box.

   <li>For launch overlays (foreground or background layers), the
   return value isn't used.
</ul>

<a name="drawingContext"></a>
<h2>Drawing context</h2>
<p>
   When the system calls your custom drawing function, it passes
   in an argument that we call the <b>drawing context</b>.  This
   is a Javascript object that encapsulates the internal drawing
   surface that all of the graphics primitives operate on.  The
   drawing context provides a set of properties and methods that
   you call to carry out drawing operations on the drawing surface.
</p>
<p>
   The drawing surface contained in the context is, technically
   speaking, an in-memory bitmap.  More intuitively, it's like
   opening up a new, blank Photoshop image: it's a drawing
   canvas with a certain pixel size, and you can use the
   graphics primitives (the methods on the drawing context
   object) to paint different sorts of graphics into the
   blank image.
</p>
<p>
   A drawing context is only valid within the custom drawing
   function.  It stops being usable as soon as the drawing
   function returns (so you shouldn't store it anywhere global,
   to avoid accidentally using it in other scripts, where it
   would cause errors if used).
</p>


<a name="colorParameters"></a>
<h2>Color values</h2>
<p>
   Several of the drawing context methods take color values as
   arguments.  You can specify these in several ways:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>As a hex integer value, in the format 0xAARRGGBB, where
   AA is the alpha (transparency) value, RR is the red component,
   GG is the green component, and BB is the blue component.
   Each can range from 00 to FF hex.  For example, 0xFF0000FF
   represents opaque red (FF for the alpha component, or
   completely opaque, and FF for the red component, for maximum
   brightness in that component).
   <p>
      If you're familiar with HTML "#rrggbb" color values, these values
      will look almost the same, with the differences that you replace
      the "#" sign with the Javascript "hex" prefix <b>0x</b>, and you
      always have to add an <b>FF</b> at the beginning to indicate that
      the color is opaque.  For example, the HTML color code #123456 would
      be written in your custom drawing code as <b>0xFF123456</b>.
   </p>
   <p>
      In this format, if the alpha component (AA) is zero, the
      <b>defaultAlpha</b> property of the drawing context is
      automatically used.  See "Default alpha values" below.
   </p>

   <li>As an HTML-style "#RGB" color string.  For example, #00F
   represents solid red.  For HTML-style colors, the opacity
   is always fully opaque.

   <li>As an HTML-style "#RRGGBB" color string.  The opacity with
   this format is always fully opaque.

   <li>As a pseudo-HTML string in the format "#AARRGGBB".  In
   other words, the normal HTML color format, with the addition of
   an alpha component (the "AA" portion), to let you specify an
   alpha value explicitly.

   <li>As the name of a configuration variable from the settings
   file.  This lets you refer to color from the settings rather
   than having to look it up as a separate step.
</ul>

<h2>Default alpha value</h2>
<p>
   For convenience, you don't have to specify the alpha value in each
   individual color parameter.
</p>
<ul>
   <li>For a color parameter passed as a hex integer value, if the
   alpha component is zero, the default alpha value from the drawing
   context is automatically used.

   <li>For a color passed as an HTML-style "#RGB" or "#RRGGBB" string,
   full opacity (alpha FF) is always used, regardless of the default
   alpha in the drawing context.
</ul>
   
</p>
<p>
   The default alpha value is given by the <b>defaultAlpha</b> property
   of the drawing context.  You can read this property to get the current
   default, and write it to set the new default that will apply to
   subsequent method calls on the drawing context.
</p>
<p>
   The system always sets <b>defaultAlpha</b> to 0xFF before calling your
   custom drawing function.  (This happens on <b>every</b> call to a custom
   drawing function, so you don't have to worry about whether other drawing
   functions that were called before the current one might have changed it.)
</p>
<p>
   Note that if you explicitly want to draw an area with an alpha of 00,
   meaning fully transparent, you must set <b>defaultAlpha</b> to zero first.
   Since the system always replaces a zero alpha in a color parameter with
   the default alpha value, the only way to actually get a zero alpha in
   the final color setting is to set the default to zero.  That will replace
   the 00 alpha you specify in the color parameter with the 00 in the
   <b>defaultAlpha</b> property, leaving the zero alpha unchanged for
   the final coloring.
</p>

<h2>Text drawing</h2>
<p>
   The drawing context methods below include a number of primitives
   related to drawing text strings.  Those are suitable for simple
   text displays where you only need to display text in a single style
   at a time; for simple tasks, they're easy to use and lightweight
   in terms of performance impact.  However, they're not powerful
   enough for more complex tasks where you want to display text
   containing a mixture of styles, especially if the text needs
   to be word-wrapped to display paragraphs or more complex
   layouts.  For something like
   that, you should instead use <a href="StyledText.html">StyledText</a>
   or <a href="HtmlLayout.html">HtmlLayout</a>.  Those
   classes provide higher-level interfaces for complex text
   layout tasks, and they both readily inter-operate with the
   primitives discussed below, so you can freely mix formatted text
   layouts with the other graphics to build up composite displays.
</p>


<h2>Drawing context methods</h2>
<p>
   The drawing context has the following methods:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>defaultAlpha:</b>  A property giving the default alpha component to
   apply to any color parameter passed to fillRect(), frameRect(), or setTextColor()
   that has a zero alpha.  For example, if <b>defaultAlpha</b> is 0x80 (meaning
   50% transparency), and you pass color code 0x0000ff (blue) to fillRect(), the system
   will notice the zero alpha in your color code and substitute the 0x80 default,
   for a final rectangle fill color of 0x800000ff (blue with 50% transparency).
   On the other hand, if you pass a color code of 0xFF0000FF, the alpha in the
   color code is already non-zero, so the default is <b>not</b> applied and the
   actual drawing color is the same as the value you specify.  Note that you
   must set <b>defaultAlpha</b> to zero if you actually want to be able to draw
   fully transparent areas, since any other value would override a zero alpha
   you specify in a color parameter.  The system always sets this to 0xFF
   (fully opaque) before <b>each</b> call to a custom drawing function, so
   that all drawing is fully opaque by default.
   
   <li><b>drawImage(<i>file</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>width</i>, <i>height</i>):</b>
   Draw an image.  <i>file</i> is the name of the image file (JPEG and PNG formats are supported);
   this can be an absolute path, or can be a path relative to the PinballY program folder.
   <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> give the top left coordinates in pixels within the popup drawing area.
      
   <li><a name="drawText"></a><b>drawText(<i>string</i>):</b>
   Draws the text in <i>string</i>, starting at
   the current text origin, within the current text area boundaries, using the
   current text font and color.  This automatically moves the text origin so that
   the next drawText() call will place its text after this text.  If <i>string</i>
   ends in a newline character ("\n"), the text origin is advanced to the start
   of the next "line", vertically just below the drawn text and at the left edge
   of the text area.  If <i>string</i> doesn't end in a newline, the text origin
   is positioned immediately to the right of the drawn text.
   <p>
      See <a href="HtmlLayout.html">HtmlLayout</a> and <a href="StyledText.html">StyledText</a>
      for alternative ways of
      drawing more complex layouts that include mixed styles.  drawText() can only
      draw text in one font style at a time, so it's difficult to use if
      you want to mix multiple font styles within a single text display. HtmlLayout
      and StyledText provide higher-level interfaces for more complex layouts, and
      they inter-operate with the rest of the Custom Drawing primitives, so they're
      like "super" versions of drawText() that work on styled text instead of
      plain text.
   </p>
   
   <li><b>fillRect(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>width</i>, <i>height</i>, <i>color</i>):</b>  Fills
   a rectangle at the given position and dimensions with the given color.
   The coordinates are in pixels relative to the popup drawing area,
   and the dimensions are in pixels.  The color is given as an 0xAARRGGBB value,
   where AA is the alpha transparency (00 for fully
   transparent, FF for fully opaque), RR is the red component (00 to FF), GG is
   the green component, and BB is the blue component. 
   
   <li><b>frameRect(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>width</i>, <i>height</i>, <i>frameWidth</i>, <i>color</i>):</b>
   Draws an outline of the given width in pixels around the specified rectangle.  The color
   is an 0xAARRGGBB value with alpha transparency, as with fillRect().  The frame is drawn such that each frame line is
   centered on the edge of the specified rectangle.  For example, if you draw a 4-pixel
   frame, two of the pixels of each edge will be drawn outside the given rectangle
   area and two of the pixels will be inside the rectangle area.
   
   <li><b>getImageSize(<i>filename</i>):</b>  Returns an object with properties {width: <i>integer</i>, height: <i>integer</i>}
   giving the dimensions in pixels of the given image file.

   <li><b>getSize():</b>  Returns an object with properties {width: <i>integer</i>, height: <i>integer</i>}
   giving the dimensions in pixels of the popup drawing area.

   <p>
      For popup boxes, if you use the "dynamic layout height" option to figure the
      popup's height based on its contents, the reported height will be invalid during
      the first pass, because the whole point of the first pass is to calculate the
      required height.  See <a href="Popups.html#dynamicLayoutHeight">Dynamic layout height</a>
      in <a href="Popups.html">Popups</a>.
   </p>
   
   <li><b>getTextOrigin():</b>  Returns an object with properties {x: <i>integer</i>, y: <i>integer</i>}
   giving the current text origin, in pixel coordinates within the popup drawing
   area.  This reflects the updates to the origin made by any drawText() calls, so
   it's helpful when laying out text across multiple lines.  It's also useful for
   calculating the layout height of a popup box dynamically; see
   <a href="Popups.html#dynamicLayoutHeight">Dynamic layout height</a>
   in <a href="Popups.html">Popups</a>.

   <li><b>measureText(<i>string</i>):</b>  Figures the pixel area required to display
   the given text.  Returns an object with properties {left: <i>integer</i>, top: <i>integer</i>,
   right: <i>integer</i>, bottom: <i>integer</i>, width: <i>integer</i>, height: <i>integer</i>},
   giving the pixel positions and dimensions of the bounding box the text would occupy
   if drawn at the current text origin.  Note that this <i>doesn't</i> take into
   account line wrapping; it measures the text as though it were going to be laid
   out in an infinitely widely boundary area.
   
   <li><b>setFont(<i>name</i>, <i>pointSize</i>, <i>weight</i>, <i>italic</i>):</b>
   Sets the text font to use for subsequent drawText() and measureText() calls.
   Any of the arguments can be passed as <b>undefined</b> to keep the values
   for the current font; for example, you can change just the point size, keeping
   the current weight, by calling <tt>dc.setFont(undefined, 24)</tt>.  The
   weight value is from 100 to 900; for most fonts, 400 is the normal weight
   and 700 is bold.  (Some fonts have extra-light and extra-bold variations,
   which is why the range is wider than 400-700, and some have semi-bold
   variations between normal and bold.)
   
   <li><b>setFontFromPrefs(<i>str</i>):</b>  Sets the text font for subsequent
   drawText() and measureText() calls to a font specified in the current
   user settings.  <i>str</i> is a string giving the name of a configuration
   variable that refers to a font.  This can be any variable name in the
   settings, including custom variables.  The standard font option
   variable names are:
   <ul class="compact">
      <li><b>MenuFont:</b> menu items
      <li><b>PopupFont:</b> base font for popup dialogs and messages
      <li><b>PopupTitleFont:</b> large font for title text in popups
      <li><b>PopupSmallerFont:</b> smaller text font in popups
      <li><b>PopupDetailFont:</b> even smaller detail text font in popups
      <li><b>MediaDetailFont:</b> small font for line items in media file listings
      <li><b>WheelFont:</b> game titles in the wheel when logos aren't available
      <li><b>HighScoreFont:</b> font for the high score list in the info box
      <li><b>InfoBoxTitleFont:</b> large font for title text in info box displays
      <li><b>InfoBoxFont:</b> font for main text in info box displays
      <li><b>InfoBoxDetailFont:</b> small font for fine print in info box displays
      <li><b>StatusFont:</b> status line font
      <li><b>CreditsFont:</b> credits message font
   </ul>
   <p>
      Alternatively, you can use the string to specify the font information
      using the format that's used in the font preference settings, without
      actually looking in the setting for a variable.  The format is
      "<i>pointSize</i> <i>weight/style</i> <i>family</i>", where
      <i>pointSize</i> is an integer giving the size in points of the text;
      <i>weight/style</i> is a combination of weight (100 to 900, or
      one of the standard weight names: thin, extralight, light, normal,
      medium, semibold, bold, ultrabold, black) and/or style ("regular"
      or "italic"), with a slash "/" separating them if both are included;
      and <i>family</i> is the font name as its appears in the Windows Fonts
      control panel.  For example, "24 bold/italic Tahoma".
   </p>

   <li><b>setTextAlign(<i>horz</i>, <i>vert</i>):</b>  Sets the text alignment
   for drawText().  Either parameter can be set to <b>undefined</b> to keep the
   current alignment for that dimension.  For <i>horz</i>, -1 means left
   alignment, 0 is center alignment, and 1 is right alignment.  For
   <i>vert</i>, -1 is top alignment, 0 is vertically centered, and
   1 is bottom alignment.  When drawing, the alignments are relative to the
   current text area and the current text origin.
   
   <li><b>setTextArea(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>width</i>, <i>height</i>):</b>
   Sets the boundaries of the current text area.  The coordinates and dimensions
   are specified in pixels relative to the popup drawing area.  The text
   boundaries are used for word-wrapping and alignment in drawText().
   
   <li><b>setTextColor(<i>color</i>):</b>  Sets the color for text drawn
   with drawText(), as an 0xAARRGGBB value, with alpha transparency (the AA
   component), the same as in fillRect().
   
   <li><b>setTextOrigin(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>):</b>  Sets the text origin
   for the next call to drawText().  The coordinates are in pixels relative
   to the popup drawing area.
   
</ul>
