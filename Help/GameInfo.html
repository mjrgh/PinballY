<h1>GameInfo</h1>

<p>
   A GameInfo object contains a Javascript reference to the system's
   internal information records on a game.  This type of object is
   returned from <a href="GameList.html#getGameInfo">gameList.getGameInfo()</a>,
   it's used to indicate which game is selected in
   <a href="GameSelectEvent.html">gameselect</a> events, and
   is used in most other contexts where the system refers to a
   particular game in its database.
</p>
<p>
   The properties of a GameInfo object are actually "getters" that
   access the program's live database of loaded games.  Javascript
   doesn't allow assigning new values to getter properties, so
   you can't change a game's properties by direct assignment.
   Instead, you use the <a href="#update"><b>update()</b></a> method,
   which takes a descriptor object with the properties to modify.
   The update() method lets you change multiple properties in a
   single operation, which is good because changes to a game's
   metadata can trigger time-consuming side effects, such as updating
   the XML file containing the game and redrawing the wheel UI.
   You'll usually want to change several properties at the same
   time when updating a game, so it would be extremely inefficient
   to do repeat of the extra side-effect work for each individual
   property change.  update() lets you group changes into a
   batch, so that the side effects (XML updates, wheel refresh)
   are only done once for the batch.
</p>


<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>
   You don't create GameInfo objects directly.  You get them from
   the system, such as from the <b>game</b> property of the
   <a href="GameSelectEvent.html">gameselect</a> event, or by
   calling <a href="GameList.html#getGameInfo">gameList.getGameInfo()</a>.
</p>

<h2>Lifetime</h2>
<p>
   A GameInfo object is a Javascript object, so it has the usual
   rules for Javascript object lifetime, which is to say that it
   stays valid as long as you have a reference to it somewhere in
   your program.
</p>
<p>
   The system's internal game record for a given game, however,
   can be deleted if the game database is reloaded and that game
   isn't included in the reloaded game set.  The game
   database is reloaded any time the user changes settings (for
   example, via the interactive Settings dialog), since changes
   to the settings can affect which folders are scanned for games
   and XML game list files.
</p>
<p>
   If the system's internal game record for a game is deleted due
   to a settings change, and you're still holding on to a GameInfo
   object that references that now-deleted game, the GameInfo object
   itself is perfectly valid, per the normal Javascript rules.
   However, the methods that it uses to access the live game
   database will all throw errors if you try to use them, because
   they'll see that the underlying system game record no longer
   exists.
</p>
<p>
   In most cases, the easiest way to avoid any hassles with
   deleted game records is to avoid caching or storing GameInfo
   references in global variables or object properties.  Rely
   instead on system calls or events that give you up-to-date
   information on whatever game you're interested in.  For
   example, if you want to access information on the current
   game shown in the wheel UI, call gameList.getWheelGame(0)
   to get the actual current game, rather than keeping a
   separate global variable with the GameInfo object from
   some past event.
</p>
<p>
   If for some reason you do need to hang on to GameInfo objects
   for longer than it takes to process the current event, you
   can use <a href="SettingsChangeEvent.html"><b>settingschange</b></a>
   events to clear out old references.  That event tells you whenever
   the system has reloaded the settings, which implies reloading
   the game list.
</p>


<a name="gameID"></a>
<h2>Game IDs</h2>
<p>
   The <b>id</b> property of the GameInfo object is a special
   internal identifier that the system uses to find the
   in-memory data structure for the game.  This has a unique
   value for each loaded game, and it remains the same for
   each game as long as it's included in the loaded game list.
</p>
<p>
   One important use for the <b>id</b> value is to compare two
   GameInfo objects to see if they refer to the same game.  If they
   do, their <b>id</b> properties will be equal.
</p>
<div class="code">
let a = gameList.getWheelGame(0);  // current game on wheel
let b = gameList.getWheelGame(1);  // next game on wheel

// DON'T do this!:  if (a == b)
// That doesn't work, because a and b could be different GameInfo
// objects that both refer to the same internal game record.
//
// Instead, to this:
if (a.id == b.id) { /* a and b refer to the same game */ }
</div>
   
<p>
   A game ID value isn't permanent; it's only valid as long as the
   in-memory object for the game exists.  The in-memory object for a
   game is initially created when PinballY starts up and scans for game
   files and database entries, and only exists until (a) the end of
   the current program session, or (b) the game is removed from the
   loaded game list due to a settings change, whichever comes first.
   Don't store these IDs in external files that might persist across
   sessions, as they'd be meaningless in a future session.
</p>
<p>
   You also have to be careful about saving these IDs in global
   variables, since they can become invalid any time the
   game list is re-loaded.  The program has to re-load the game lists
   any time the user updates anything in the Settings dialog, since
   settings changes can affect what's included in the game lists.
   If a game is deleted from memory after a re-load, because that
   game is no longer included in the new settings, the ID value that
   referred to the game becomes invalid.
</p>
<p>
   If you're storing ID values in global variables, you can listen for
   the <a href="SettingsChangeEvent.html"><b>settingschange</b></a> event,
   and use it to clear out old ID values.
</p>
   

<a name="configID"></a>
<h2>Config IDs</h2>
<p>
   The program has a second identifier for each game, known as the
   "config ID", that's more stable across sessions.  It's called the
   config ID because PinballY uses it to store game references in
   its own configuration files.  You can use it for similar purposes.
</p>
<p>
   The config ID is based on the game's title, manufacturer, year, and system name.
   This makes it stable across sessions, but it's not necessarily
   permanent for a given in-memory record.  Since it's based on the game's
   metadata and system assignment, the config ID for an in-memory record changes
   whenever you change the game's title, manufacturer, or year, or assign it to a
   different system, or change the display name of the player system. 
</p>
<p>
   The way to think about the config ID is as a permanent identifier for
   a game in the abstract, as opposed to a concrete file that
   implements that abstract game: "Medieval Madness for Visual Pinball 9"
   is the abstraction, and "C:\VisualPinball\Tables\mm_1234.vpt" might
   be one concrete file that implements it.
</p>

<h2>Properties and methods</h2>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.categories:</b>  An array containing the game's category tags, as
   strings.  The user can tag a game with any number of categories through
   the Game Setup menu in the wheel UI.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.configID:</b>  A string giving the configuration ID of the game.
   See <a href="#configID">Config IDs</a> above.
   PinballY uses this string to identify the game when it's referenced
   in saved settings files (e.g., to record the last game selected on
   the wheel so that it can be restored the next time the program starts).
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.dbFile:</b>  The full name (including folder path) of the XML database
   file containing this game's entry.  If the game isn't configured, this
   is undefined.  Every configured game has an entry in exactly one XML file.
   The XML file is always associated with the game's designated player system,
   but any given system can have multiple XML files, because HyperPin and
   PinballX used the file location as a simple category system.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.dateAdded:</b>  A Date value representing the time and date when the
   database entry for the game was added to PinballY.  Undefined if the game hasn't
   been configured.
</p>
<p>
   Javascript represents dates internally in a time zone-independent
   fashion, and PinballY does the same thing in its databases.  This
   generally makes operations on date values straightforward, since you
   don't have to worry about time zone trivia like daylight time changes;
   Javascript handles those sorts of things automatically.  You can use
   all of the normal Javascript Date functions with this value.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.displayName:</b>  The display name for the game.  This is the name that the
   program displays on-screen for the game, such as in the wheel UI and the game information
   popup box.  The standard format for this is "Title (Manufacturer Year)", when all of
   those items are available.  If no title has been manually entered, the playable game
   file (if any) is used in its place.  The manufacturer and/or year are omitted if
   they're not set in the game's XML database entry or if it has no entry.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.erase():</b>  Erases the XML game list entry for the game.
   The game record remains in memory, because that's tied to the game file, and the
   statistics related to the playable game file (such as total play time and count)
   are kept.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.filename:</b>  The filename of the game <i>as it appears in the XML
   database file</i>.  This might or might not include a path and/or extension;
   the format can vary because these XML files can come from different sources
   (HyperPin tools, PinballX tools, or manual data entry from users).  PinballY
   accepts these variations when reading the files, but it always uses a
   uniform format when making updates, storing the filename only, with no
   path or extension.  If your database files were created with PinballY,
   you'll always see that format.  If you manually edited the files or
   migrated data from another system, though, the path and/or extension
   might be present.
</p>
<p>
   Note that the filename here is the manually entered filename from the
   database, so it might or might not refer to an actual, existing file.
   It also doesn't typically include any path information, since files are
   usually assumed to be in the table file folder for the associated system.
   You can get the actual file system information on the file, including its
   full path, extension, and whether or not the file exists, via 
   <a href="#resolveGameFile">resolveGameFile()</a>.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="getHighScores"></a>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.getHighScores():</b>  Get the high scores for this game.
   This function operates asynchronously, since high scores are retrieved
   by a separate program.  Instead of directly returning the score information,
   the function returns a Javascript Promise object, which is resolved when
   the high score information is retrieved successfully.  The promise can also
   be rejected, which can happen if the game has no high score information
   or the PinEMHi launch attempt fails.  On success, the "resolve" callback
   is invoked with an array of strings, containing the high score text
   returned from PinEMHi, one line of text per array element.  See
   <a href="#highScores">Retrieving high scores</a> below for a usage example.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.gridPos:</b>  An object with properties .row and .column, both integers,
   giving the "grid position" of the game as stored in the game database.  This is
   mostly provided as a special case for Farsight's <i>The Pinball Arcade</i>, which
   doesn't provide any sort of command-line option to let an external program launch a specific game, but
   instead always presents its own game selection UI at startup.  The grid position
   is a (poor) attempt to work around that by enabling PinballY to send a series
   of simulated keystrokes to TPA to navigate the selection UI automatically.
   The selection UI arranges all of the games into a rectangular grid, so in
   principle you can send a series of keystrokes to launch a particular game
   if you know its position in the grid.  In practice this has proven to be
   unreliable, since TPA's startup UI is too unpredictable: it frequently pops
   up extra startup alert messages that throw the key macros out of sync, for example,
   and of course the grid layout changes every time they add a game.  Plus they
   change the overall UI from time to time.  Even so, PinballY provides this
   information for users who want to try to make it work.
</p>

<p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.highScoreStyle:</b>  A string with the high score style for the game,
   for the purposes of generating the automatic high score display in the video DMD
   window.  This should be one of "Auto", "DMD", "Alpha", "TT", or "None".  It can
   also be undefined if no high score style has been set (in which case the system
   uses the "Auto" default).
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.id:</b>  An integer giving the internal <a href="#gameID">Game ID</a>,
   which the system uses to locate its in-memory record for the game.  This
   value is unique per game, so this can be used to determine if two GameInfo
   objects refer to the same game.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.ipdbId:</b>  A string giving the <a href="https://www.ipdb.org">IPDB</a>
   ID of the game.  This is the database key that IPDB uses to identify the game; all of
   the existing entries are in the form of a decimal number, but we use a string to
   store the ID just in case IPDB ever expands the format to allow non-digit characters.  The ID for
   a given game should be permanent, and it should be unique across all of the pinball
   machines known to IPDB.  The ID can used to address the game's IPDB page via a URL of
   the form <tt>https://www.ipdb.org/machine.cgi?id=<i>ipdbId</i></tt>.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.isConfigured:</b>  A boolean value indicating if the game has been
   configured.  A configured game has an XML database entry; an unconfigured game
   represents a playable game file that PinballY found in a system's table folder,
   but which doesn't have a corresponding XML database entry.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.isFavorite:</b>  A boolean indicating if the game is marked as a favorite.
   The user can designate a game as a favorite through the main menu in the wheel UI.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.isHidden:</b>  A boolean value indicating if the game has been hidden.
   The user can hide a game via the Game Setup menu in the wheel UI.  A hidden
   game isn't shown in the wheel UI <i>except</i> when the "Hidden Games"
   filter is selected.  The system still keeps track of hidden games
   internally, though, specifically so that it can remember not to display
   them in the normal wheel UI when it discovers their game files during the
   table folder scan at startup.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.isMarkedForCapture:</b>  A boolean value indicating if the game has
   been marked for capture.  The user can mark games for capture through the
   Game Setup menu in the wheel UI.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.lastPlayed:</b>  A Date value representing the time and date when the
   game was last launched from PinballY.  Undefined if the game has never been played.
   As with dateAdded, you can use all of the normal Javascript Date functions with this
   value.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.manufacturer:</b>  A string with the name of the manufacturer, if set.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.mediaName:</b>  The "media name" for the game.  This is the root filename
   (without path or extension) used for all of the game's media files.  To form
   the full file system name of a particular media file (e.g., the playfield video),
   the system combines the directory path for the file type, the media name, and a
   filename extension for the type.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.path:</b>  The full file system path of the directory containing the
   file, if known.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.playCount:</b>  An integer giving the number of times the game has
   been launched from PinballY.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.playTime:</b>  An integer giving the total amount of time the game has
   been played when started from PinballY, in seconds.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.rating:</b>  A number giving the user's "star" rating entry for the
   game (0 to 5, in increments of 0.5: 2.5 represents 2&frac12; stars).  The
   special value -1 means the game has no rating.  Note that 0 stars is a
   valid rating, <i>not</i> the absence of a rating.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="renameMediaFiles"></a>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.renameMediaFiles(<i>array</i>):</b>  Rename the media files
   as specified in <i>array</i>.  See <a href="#renamingMedia">Renaming media files</a>
   below for details.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="resolveGameFile"></a>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.resolveGameFile():</b>  Resolves the playable game file for this game.
   This finds the folder location and filename of the game file, by combining
   information from the game database entry and the system configuration,
   using the same algorithm that PinballY uses internally to find the
   file when launching the game.  The return value is an object with
   the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>exists:</b> true if the file exists, false if not.
   
   <li><b>filename:</b> the base filename, with no folder path.  This
   includes the filename extension for the player system, if any (e.g.,
   ".vpx" for Visual Pinball 10 files).  Note that this might not
   match the .filename property in the object returned from getGameInfo(),
   The getGameInfo() filename is exactly what's specified in the XML
   database entry for the game, which usually omits the extension.
   The resolveGameFile() filename, in contrast, does include the extension,
   <i>if</i> it's necessary to add the extension to find an existing file.
   No extension is added to the name from the XML file when that name
   by itself (with no added extension) refers to an extant file.
   
   <li><b>folder:</b> the full path of the folder containing the file,
   which is usually the same as the table folder for the player system.
   
   <li><b>path:</b> the full path of the final file, which combines the
   .folder and .filename values to form the absolute path.  This is in
   a format suitable to be used with file system operations on the file,
   since it's the full name of the file and doesn't depend on any
   assumptions about working folders or default extensions.
</ul>

<p>
   <a name="resolveMedia"></a>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.resolveMedia(<i>type</i>, <i>mustExist</i>):</b>  Resolves the
   game's media file(s) of the given type.  <i>type</i> is a media type
   name, which must match one of the following exactly:
</p>
<ul class="compact">
   <li>"bg image"
   <li>"bg video"
   <li>"dmd image"
   <li>"dmd video"
   <li>"flyer image"
   <li>"inst card image"
   <li>"launch audio"
   <li>"real dmd color image"
   <li>"real dmd color video"
   <li>"real dmd image"
   <li>"real dmd video"
   <li>"table audio"
   <li>"table image"
   <li>"table video"
   <li>"topper image"
   <li>"topper video"
   <li>"wheel image"
</ul>

<p>
   <i>mustExist</i> is a boolean indicating whether the function
   should return only files that actually exist, or the names of all
   possible files of the type, even if they don't exist.
</p>
<p>
   The return value is an array of strings giving the names of the
   matched files.  Each filename includes its full absolute directory
   path.  An array is returned even if no files are matched; in
   this case the array is simply empty.
</p>
<p>
   There are two reasons that the function can return multiple files
   for a single media type.  The first is that most media types support
   multiple formats, and some of the formats might have multiple
   extensions; for example, most of the image types will match .png, .jpg,
   and .jpeg files.  When <i>mustExist</i> is false, the function returns
   all of the <i>possible</i> matching files, with all of the supported
   formats for the type and all recognized extensions for each format.
   The order of the names returned in this case reflects PinballY's
   order of preference for choosing files when more than one matching
   file exists: the program picks pick the first item in the list that
   corresponds to an existing file.  If you want to determine which file
   that PinballY will actually display for this type when the game is
   selected in the wheel UI, call the function with <i>mustExist</i>
   set to true, and then simply use the first array element.  
</p>
<p>
   The second reason that the function can return multiple files is
   that some of the media types can actually have multiple associated
   items.  In particular, flyer images can use multiple files to
   represent the separate pages of a multi-page flyer, or the
   front and back sides of a single page; instruction cards can
   contain collections of cards with different rule variations
   or different language versions.  For these types, the program
   lets the user cycle through the multiple items when displayed
   by using the Next/Previous buttons.  
</p>

<p>
   <a name="resolveROM"></a>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.resolveROM():</b>  Resolves the ROM file for this game.  This
   tries to determine which ROM file for the game is installed for use
   with VPinMAME, if any, and which ROM name is associated with the
   game in the current DOF configuration.  The return value is an
   object with the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>dofRom:</b>  The name of the game's ROM for DOF configuration
   purposes, if any.  DOF determines which effects to use when a game is
   running under Visual Pinball and other systems by matching the game's
   ROM name (as VP sees it) to the ROM names listed in the DOF .ini files.
   PinballY uses this scheme to trigger game-specific DOF effects
   for the game currently selected in the wheel UI, so PinballY needs to
   be able to determine the ROM associated with each game.  The .dofRom
   property reflects PinballY's determination of the DOF ROM name, which
   comes from either an explicit "rom" node in the game's XML database
   entry, or a search of the DOF ROM list by table title.  The .dofRom
   property is undefined if DOF isn't being used during this PinballY
   session (e.g., if DOF isn't installed, or DOF is disabled in the
   PinballY settings), or if PinballY can't find a matching DOF ROM name.
   
   <li><b>vpmRom:</b>  The name of the ROM that VPinMAME uses
   for this game.  If the game has a ROM setting in the XML database
   file, that value is used.  Otherwise, the system tries to match the
   game by title to an internal database of title-to-ROM associations,
   and then tries to determine which version is in use by checking
   VPinMAME's registry data (since VPM stores information in the
   Windows registry about each ROM it's loaded in the past).
   This is undefined if the VPM ROM can't be determined.
   
   <li><b>vpmRomFile:</b>  The full filename, including path and
   extension, of the VPM ROM file for the game, if available.  This
   is the file path for the ROM contained in the .vpmRom property.
   This is undefined if the VPM ROM can't be determined, or if no
   file exists for the ROM in the .vpmRom property.
   
   <li><b>nvramPath:</b>  The full filename, including path and
   extension, of the non-volatile RAM file for the game, if available.
   The format of the file varies by player system, but if present, it's
   the file that the player system uses to store high scores and menu
   settings for the game.  VPinMAME uses the file to emulate the
   non-volatile RAM hardware in the original games, for example.
   PinballY uses this file to read high scores through PinEMHi.
   This property is undefined if no NVRAM file can be found.
</ul>

<p>
   The DOF and VPinMAME ROM names often differ in the version number
   suffix.  Most machines that use ROM software have several versions
   of the ROM available; for example, for <i>Medieval Madness</i>,
   you'll find ROM versions mm_05, mm_10, mm_109, mm_109b, and mm_109c.
   DOF typically drops the version suffix so that its .ini file entry
   can match any version of the same game, so the DOF .ini entry for
   <i>Med Mad</i> is just "mm".  That's what you'll see in the
   .dofRom result.  VPM, on the other hand, uses an exact version,
   so the .vpmRom result will include the version suffix.
</p>
<p>
   Note that ROM associations may be found even for games written for
   systems that don't use VPinMAME, such as Future Pinball, so you
   shouldn't assume that a valid VPM ROM in the result means that the
   game actually uses the ROM.  The ROM lookup includes a search by title,
   so if there's a ROM for any version of a title, it will likely be found
   even for non-VPM versions of the same game.  For example, if you ask
   for the ROM for a Future Pinball version of <i>Medieval Madness</i>,
   the system will find the <i>MM</i> ROM even though Future Pinball
   doesn't use it.  This is actually useful for PinballY
   internally, since the program's main use for the ROM association is
   to select the DOF effects for the same game.  But it might be
   confusing if you're trying to do something specifically tied to
   VPM's use of the ROM.  It's difficult to determine in general if
   a particular game implementation uses a particular ROM version,
   since that depends on both the player system and internal details
   of the game implementation that aren't exposed in a usable way.
</p>

   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.rom:</b>  The name of the ROM for the game, if a ROM has been entered
   manually in the database.  The ROM name can usually be inferred from the title,
   so this is usually undefined.  You can use <a href="#resolveROM">resolveROM()</a>
   to get more information about PinballY's determination of the game's ROM.
   That function gives you access to the machinery inside PinballY that does the
   title lookups, and it returns details about the ROM for different uses.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.system:</b>  A <a href="GameSysInfo.html">GameSysInfo</a> object
   indicating which player system this game uses.  That object's properties
   provide information on the configuration settings for the system.
</p>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.tableType:</b>  A string giving the game type code, <a href="https://www.ipdb.org/showhelp.pl?item=type">per IPDB</a>.
   This is undefined if the game isn't configured or no type code has been entered.
   The valid values are:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>"SS" = Solid State: the game is controlled by a microprocessor or other
   solid-state electronics, and uses an LED, plasma, or video display for scoring

   <li>"EM" = Electro-mechanical: the game's scoring and rules are controlled by
   Steam Age computing machinery made up of relays, motors, and cams, and scoring
   is displayed using score wheels or scoring indicator lights

   <li>"ME" = Pure mechanical: these are the very first pinball-like games, from
   the 1930s and before, that have no electrical features at all apart from
   simple static elements such as ambient lighting
</ul>

<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.title:</b>  The title of the game.  If the game has been configured, this
   is the title manually entered by the user; it's generally the title that the game
   is officially known by, such as "The Addams Family" or "Funhouse".  If the game
   hasn't been configured, this is simply the filename.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="setHighScores"</a>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.setHighScores(<i>scores</i>):</b>  Sets the game's high score
   data.  <i>scores</i> is an array of string value giving the new high score text.
   See <a href="#customHighScores">Custom high scores</a> below for information
   on how this should be formatted.
</p>
<p>
   If <i>scores</i> is null or undefined, any previously retrieved high scores for
   the game are forgotten.  This causes PinballY to retrieve the high scores again
   the next time the game is selected in the wheel UI.  This is useful when you
   know that the actual stored scores have changed or might have changed.  PinballY
   itself automatically clears its internal high scores for a given game each time
   the game is launched for play, since a new high score could be added on any run.
</p>
<p>
   Note that setHighScores() doesn't affect any externally stored high score
   information.  This can't be used, for example, to update an NVRAM file with
   new high scores.  setHighScores() only affects PinballY's in-memory copy of
   the high score information that it uses to generate high score displays on
   the DMD and info box popups.
</p>

<p>
   <a name="update"></a>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.update(<i>desc</i>, <i>options</i>):</b>  Update the game's properties.  This updates the
   in-memory record for the game and saves the changes to the XML database file
   where the game is listed.  It also updates the UI as needed to reflect the
   changes.  See <a href="#updatingGames">Updating metadata</a> below for more
   details.
</p>
<p>
   <b><i>gameInfo</i>.year:</b>  An integer giving the game's original release year (e.g., 1995),
   if set in the game database.
</p>

<a name="updatingGames"></a>
<h2>Updating game metadata</h2>

<p>
   You can't change game metadata by assigning new values to GameInfo
   properties.  The properties are read-only "getter" methods, so they
   can't be changed by direct assignment.  Instead, you can use the
   update() method:
</p>
<div class="indented">
   <i>gameInfoObject</i>.update(<i>desc</i>, <i>options</i>);
</div>
<p>
<p>
   <i>desc</i> is an object containing the properties to be updated in the game
   metadata.  Only the properties actually set in the object are updated; properties
   not set are left unchanged.  This lets you selectively update whatever subset
   of properties you wish to change without affecting the others.  The properties
   to be updated have the same names as in the GameInfo object, and accept the
   same sorts of values.
</p>
<p>
   <i>options</i> is an object specifying options via its properties.  You can
   omit this if you want to use default options.  The option properties are:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>renameMedia:</b> a boolean specifying whether or not any media files
   currently associated with the game should be renamed to match the new media
   name implied by changes to the title, manufacturer, and/or year.  The default
   option is <b>true</b>, which means that the function performs any necessary
   renaming.  If this is false, the function doesn't rename any files, so media
   files that were previously displayed for the game will no longer be displayed,
   as they'll no longer match the media name.  You can carry out the renaming
   operations yourself via <i>gameInfo</i>.renameMedia() if desired, using the
   file renaming list returned in the results object.
</ul>

<p>
   The return value from update() is an object value that contains information
   about the operation.  This contains the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>renamedMediaFiles:</b> If the changed properties affect the game's
   media file base name, and the game has any existing media files associated
   with it, this property will be set to an array with the list of files that
   needs to be renamed to maintain the association with the game.  The property
   will be undefined if no files need to be renamed (either because the media
   name didn't change, or because there were no existing files with the old
   media name).  This will be set to the list of affected files whether or not
   update() carries out the renaming itself, which depends on the <b>renameMedia</b>
   property in the options object argument.  If you pass <b>false</b> for the
   <b>renameMedia</b> option, and you wish to rename the files yourself, you
   can do so by passing the <b>renamedMediaFiles</b> array to the <a href="#renameMediaFiles">renameMediaFiles()</a>
   method of the GameInfo object.
   <p>
      The elements of the <b>renamedMediaFiles</b> array are objects, with
      properties {<b>oldName:</b> <i>string</i>, <b>newName:</b> <i>string</i>}, giving the
      old and new filenames of the affected files.  The filenames include
      the full directory path and extensions, so these can be used in
      file system APIs to refer to the exact files.  Note, however, that
      it might not be possible write to, rename, or delete these files at
      the operating system API level if the game is selected in the UI,
      because the files might be locked for video and/or audio playback.
      The renameMediaFiles() method takes this into account and can be
      called even if the game is currently selected.
   </p>

   <li><b>mediaRenameErrors:</b>  If the function attempts to rename any
   media files, and any errors occur trying to rename the files, this property
   is set to an array containing details on the errors.  Each element of the
   array is an object with properties {<b>message:</b> <i>string</i>, <b>details:</b> <i>string</i>},
   with a "friendly" error message to display to users in <b>message</b>,
   and possibly a lower-level technical error message (typically a Windows
   API-level error message with error code) in <b>details</b>, if more
   technical details are available.  <b>mediaRenameErrors</b> will be
   undefined if the function doesn't even attempt to rename files (which
   will be the case if the media name wasn't affected by the update,
   there were no existing media files associated with the game under
   the old name, or the <b>renameMedia</b> option is false), or if
   all files were renamed successfully.
</ul>

<p>
   The metadata properties that can be updated, and thus the valid properties
   for the <i>desc</i> object, are:
</p>
<ul class="compact">
   <li>categories (array of strings)
   <li>dateAdded (Date)
   <li>gridPos (object, {row: <i>integer</i>, column: <i>integer</i>})
   <li>highScoreStyle (string: "Auto", "Alpha", "DMD", "TT", "None")
   <li>ipdbId (string)
   <li>isFavorite (boolean)
   <li>isHidden (boolean)
   <li>isMarkedForCapture (boolean)
   <li>lastPlayed (Date)
   <li>manufacturer (string)
   <li>playCount (integer)
   <li>playTime (integer, total play time in seconds)
   <li>rating (number, 0 to 5 in increments of 0.5 for half stars; -1 for "unrated")
   <li>rom (string)
   <li>system (<a href="GameSysInfo.html">GameSysInfo</a> object)
   <li>tableType (string: "SS", "EM", "ME")
   <li>title (string)
   <li>year (integer)
</ul>

<p>
   For example, here's how you'd change the title, year, and manufacturer
   for a game record:
</p>
<div class="code">
let game = gameList.getWheelGame(0);
game.update({
    title: "Theatre of Magic",
    manufacturer: "Bally",
    year: 1995
});
</div>

<p>
   Note that the list of valid <i>desc</i> properties doesn't include all of the GameInfo
   properties.  Some of the GameInfo properties reflect derived values (that is, values
   computed from other properties), which can't be updated by themselves.  Derived values
   will automatically be updated to reflect changes to the properties they're computed
   from, though; for example, you can't set the <b>displayName</b> property
   directly, but changing the year or manufacturer will affect the computed
   value of <b>displayName</b>.  Any properties in the <i>desc</i> object other
   than ones listed above are ignored.
</p>
<p>
   The <b>system</b> property is restricted.  If the game record is associated
   with an existing game file, the system can only be changed to another system
   that keeps its table files in the same folder.  A game record that's tied to
   a file is permanently associated with that file, and each system's games can
   only be loaded from one folder, so changing to a system that uses a different
   table folder would make the game record unusable.  If the game isn't associated
   with an existing file, its system can't be changed at all, because that could
   create a conflict with an existing file in the new system's table folder.
</p>

<a name="renamingMedia"></a>
<h2>Renaming media files</h2>

<p>
   Changing a game's metadata sometimes has the side effect of changing the
   base filename template for the game's associated media files, since the
   media name template is based on the game's title, manufacturer, and year.
   Changing any of these properties will change the implied media base name.
</p>
<p>
   By default, <a href="#update"><i>gameInfo</i>.update()</a> automatically
   renames any existing media files to the new implied name as needed.
   This is desirable in most cases, since it lets you update the metadata
   elements without breaking any file associations.  You don't have to do
   anything if you want to let the function rename affected files
   automatically.
</p>
<p>
   If you prefer, though, you can tell update() <i>not</i> to rename affected
   media files automatically, by setting <b>renameMedia</b> to false
   in the <i>options</i> object argument to update().  This might be
   desirable if you're intentionally manipulating a game's metadata
   separately from its file associations, or if you want to leave it up
   to the user to decide on the renaming.  PinballY's own UI takes
   the latter approach:  when a metadata change made through the "Edit Game
   Details" dialog affects the game's media name template, the dialog
   tells the user about it and asks the user to decide whether to rename
   the files to match the new media name or leave them as they are.
</p>
<p>
   If you do want to base the renaming decision on some outside factor, either
   the user's input or something else that you need to compute on the
   fly, you can use the following procedure:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Call update(), with <b>renameMedia</b> set to <b>false</b> in the options.

   <li>Check the result object returned from update().  If it has
   the property <b>renamedMediaFiles</b>, that contains an array of the
   affected files, with their old and new names.  Nothing has been renamed
   yet, since you set the <b>renameMedia</b> option to false, so this is
   the list of proposed changes needed to maintain the current file
   associations.  If you hadn't set <b>renameMedia</b> to false,
   the <b>renamedMediaFiles</b> array would have exactly the same contents,
   but it would reflect name changes that had already been applied,
   since update() would have attempted to rename everything itself
   if you hadn't specifically told it not to.

   <li>Now that you know that some renaming is necessary, figure out what
   you want to do about it.  For example, if
   you want to prompt the user interactively, you could display a menu
   explaining the situation and asking whether or not to rename the files.

   <li>If you decide to rename the files after all, call
   <a href="#renameMediaFiles"><i>gameInfo.</i>renameMediaFiles()</a>,
   passing in the <b>renamedMediaFiles</b> array from update() as the argument.
   Check the return value for errors if you wish to display or log
   any problems.

   <li>If you decide <i>not</i> to rename the files, there's nothing
   more to do.  Simply forget the rename list and go on with other work.
</ul>
<p>
   By the way, you might wonder why we go to all of this trouble to
   separate the update and rename steps, when we could have just asked
   the user up front about the renaming, before even attempting the
   update.  The reason to separate the steps is that it's hard to know
   in advance if any renaming will be necessary, and you'd probably
   rather not bother the user with the question until you know whether it
   requires an answer in the first place.  If you're performing updates as
   part of an automated process that updates many games en masse, you'll
   probably want to decide up front about renaming, so in that case you
   can skip the two-step process and do everything in update().  The
   two-step process is only needed when you want to defer the decision
   about renaming until you know that renaming is actually needed.
</p>

<p>
   <b>How to use renameMediaFiles():</b>
   renameMediaFiles(<i>array</i>) takes an array of objects listing the
   files to be renamed.   The array elements are objects with
   properties {<b>oldName:</b> <i>string</i>, <b>newName:</b> <i>string</i>},
   listing the existing name and new name for each file to rename.  The
   filenames are all given with full absolute paths.  Each
   array element corresponds to one file to be renamed.  This is the exact
   same array format returned from <a href="#update">update()</a> in the
   <b>renamedMediaFiles</b> property of the results object returned from
   that method, so you can pass the <b>renamedMediaFiles</b> array from
   update() directly to renameMediaFiles() to carry out the renaming
   that update() would have done itself if given permission.
</p>
<p>
   The renameMediaFiles() method carries out all of the listed rename
   operations.  This method temporarily stops any playing video or
   audio in the current game to ensure that the UI doesn't have playback
   locks on the files that would prevent the renaming, so you might see
   the playing videos in the UI restart when you call this method.
   All of the renames are attempted, even if some of them fail.  An
   accounting of any errors is returned in the results object.
</p>
<p>
   The return value from renameMediaFiles() is an object with the following
   properties:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>mediaRenameErrors:</b>  If any errors occurred renaming files,
   this returns an array of objects.  Each object represents one attempted
   file rename operation, and contains properties {<b>message:</b> <i>string</i>,
   <b>details:</b> <i>string</i>}.  The <b>message</b> string is a "friendly"
   message for display to the user; <b>details</b>, if present at all, has
   the low-level error message from the operating system, which can be
   logged in case a programmer has to look at the problem, but might not be
   very helpful to non-technical users.
</ul>

<p>
   <b>Using renameMediaFiles() without update():</b>  You're free to
   call renameMediaFiles() as a standalone method without changing any
   game metadata via update().  Just prepare the array of rename objects
   in the same format returned from update().  It's better to use
   renameMediaFiles() than to go directly through Windows file system
   APIs, since renameMediaFiles() accounts for the possibility that
   the files are locked for video or audio playback in the UI; trying
   to rename files directly through Windows APIs can fail due to
   lock conflicts if any of the files are currently being displayed.
   On the other hand, it's better not to use renameMediaFiles() for
   anything other than actual game media files, since the routine
   will interrupt playback in the UI, exactly because it tries to
   make sure that the files aren't locked for playback.  So it's
   not recommended to use this routine as a generic way to
   rename random files.

<a name="highScores"></a>
<h2>Retrieving high scores</h2>

<p>
   The game information object method <a href="#getHighScores">getHighScores()</a>
   lets you get the high score information for a game, if it's available.  This function
   works asynchronously: it doesn't directly return the high score information, but rather
   returns a Javascript Promise object, which invokes a callback you provide when
   the background operation completes.  Promises are a newer Javascript feature
   that are now supported in all major browsers, so you can find plenty of
   information about them on the Web if you're not familiar with the concept.
</p>
<p>
   The reason that we have to use the asynchronous Promise scheme is that high
   scores are obtained via a separate program, PinEMHi.  We launch that as
   a child process, which can take
   a couple of seconds, so we don't want to hold up the UI waiting for it to finish.
   Instead, we launch the program in the background, and let it run separately
   while we carry on with our regular UI activity.  When PinEMHi finishes, we 
   go back to processing the results.  The Javascript Promise was designed for
   exactly this type of scenario, and it makes the asynchronous handling easy
   to code.
</p>
<p>
   Here's the process for retrieving high scores:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>Retrieve the game information object for the desired game via
   gameList.getGameInfo(<i>id</i>), passing the ID of the game of interest
   
   <li>Call <i>info</i>.getHighScores(), where <i>info</i> is the object
   you got back from getGameInfo()

   <li>The return value from getHighScores() is a Promise object, so you call
   .then(<i>completionFunction</i>) on the result of getHighScores() to set up
   the completion function

   <li>In the completion function, you write your script code to handle the
   results

   <li>If you want to include special handling for errors, you can include
   a .catch(<i>errorFunction</i>) 
</ul>

<p>
   The completion function that you provide to .then() takes a single argument,
   which is an array of strings containing the results from PinEMHi.  This
   is simply the PinEMHi text output, broken up into one string per line of
   text.
</p>
<p>
   The array of strings has an extra property, <b>source</b>, which has
   a string value identifying the source of the score data.  This uses the same values
   as the <b>source</b> property in a <a href="HighScoresEvent#source"><b>highscoresready</b></a>
   event.
</p>
<p>
   Here's an example that gets the high scores for each new game that's
   selected in the wheel UI, and displays the results on the debugger
   console.
</p>
<div class="code">
gameList.on("gameselect", ev =&gt; {
    // if a game is selected, request its high scores
    if (ev.game)
    {
        ev.game.getHighScores().then(scores =&gt;
            console.log(ev.game.title + " - High Scores:\n  " + scores.join("\n  ")
                        + "\nSource: " + scores.source);
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   There's no error handler in this example, so any errors
   will simply be ignored.   If you wanted to add a message in case
   of error, you'd just add a second function that gets called on
   error to the .then() call:
</p>
<div class="code">
info.getHighScores(ev.id).then(
    scores =&gt; { /* success handler, 'scores' is an array of strings from PinEMHi */ },
    error =&gt; { /* error handler, 'error' is a Javascript Error object */ });
</div>
<p>
   This is all standard Javascript Promise coding, so if you need
   more help with Promises in general, you can find lots of tutorial
   material on the Web.
</p>

<a name="customHighScores"></a>
<h3>Setting custom high scores</h3>

<p>
   PinballY uses a separate program called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pinemhi.com/">PinEMHi</a>
   to retrieve high scores for most games.  PinEMHi works with most Visual Pinball
   games that use emulated ROMs from original arcade games, and with all
   Future Pinball games.  It doesn't work with Visual Pinball games that
   aren't based on emulated ROMs, which means it can't retrieve high
   scores for most electromechanical (EM) games written in VP.  It also
   doesn't work with any other systems, including any of the commercial
   pinball games.
</p>
<p>
   You can use Javascript to extend high score coverage to other games
   beyond what PinEMHi supports.  PinEMHi is limited to the FP and VP ROM
   games because there are no other "standard" ways of storing high
   scores, but that doesn't prevent you from adopting your own ad hoc
   methods for other types of games.  For example, you could use Visual
   Pinball's scripting capabilities to add your own custom high score
   storage to EM tables.
</p>
<p>
   The best way to extend high score coverage to your own custom storage
   locations is to listen for the <a href="HighScoresEvent.html">High
   Scores Event</a> types, and intervene for games where you know how to
   provide custom data.  A particularly good approach is to intercept
   that <b>highscoresready</b> event, and check the <i>event</i>.success
   property to identify games that PinEMHi doesn't cover:
</p>
<div class="code">
gameList.on("highscoresready", ev => {
    if (!ev.success) {
       // PinEMHi couldn't get this game's scores.  Provide our own!
       
       // First, do something here to retrieve your custom high scores.
       // ev.game contains the game object whose scores we're retrieving.
       // The scores should be prepared as an array of strings, one element
       // per display line.
       let scores = ["Custom Score Line 1", "Custom Score Line 2"];

       // now set your custom scores in the game object
       ev.game.setHighScores(scores);
    }
});
</div>

<p>
   This approach is nice because it lets PinEMHi handle everything it
   knows about, and only tries to provide custom data for games that
   PinEMHi doesn't cover.  You don't have to figure out on your own
   whether or not a game will be covered by PinEMHi, since your code
   is only invoked for games that aren't covered.
</p>
<p>
   If for some reason you wanted to <i>replace</i> the PinEMHi data
   across the board, you could do that as well: you'd listen for the
   <b>highscoresrequest</b> event, which is fired <i>before</i> PinEMHi
   is invoked, plug in your own high scores just like we did above,
   and then cancel the <b>highscoresrequest</b> event to prevent
   PinEMHi from running at all.
</p>
<div class="code">
gameList.on("highscoresrequest", ev => {
    // plug in our custom high score data
    let scores = ["Override Line 1", "Override Line 2"];
    ev.game.setHighScores(scores);

    // cancel the event so that PinballY doesn't bother invoking PinEMHi
    ev.preventDefault();
});
</div>

<p>
   We leave to you the details of how to actually retrieve the scores for
   particular games.  As mentioned earlier, there are no standards
   or conventions for how or where to store high scores other than the
   ones that PinEMHi already handles.
   So there's no one-size-fits-all approach that we can suggest for
   handling games not covered by PinEMHi.  We
   can offer a general tip, though:  whatever you do will probably
   involve reading disk files, and if you need to do that, an easy
   way is to use the Windows Scripting file system object:
</p>
<div class="code">
let fs = createAutomationObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject");
</div>
<p>
   If you've used Visual Basic or PowerShell,
   you're probably already familiar with that.  It works the
   same way in Javascript as in other languages.  If you haven't
   seen this object before, there's lots of online help for it on the Web,
   since it's widely used in Windows scripting of all sorts.
</p>

<h3>How to format high score data</h3>

<p>
   If you're providing your own custom high score text, you should
   be aware of how PinballY formats the text on the display.  This will
   help you control the appearance when it's displayed.
</p>
<p>
   PinballY automatically displays the high scores for the current
   game in its DMD video window and on your real DMD device, if you
   have one.  It alternates between displaying high scores and displaying
   the game's DMD background media (image or video), to simulate the
   way that real machines rotate through high scores and other messages
   and graphics in "game over" mode.
</p>
<p>
   On the real machines, DMDs can generally only display two or three
   lines of text at a time, since they don't have all that many pixels.
   Most alphanumeric displays (used on the late 1980s machines) have
   a fixed two-line display area.  So PinballY tries to simulate this
   appearance by breaking up the high score text into blocks of two or
   three lines of text per screen, and then showing the screens for
   a few seconds each in sequence.
</p>
<p>
   You can tell PinballY how to break up the text into screens by
   inserting blank lines into the custom text.  When PinballY
   displays the text, it scans through the list of messages and
   breaks them up into "groups" at the blank lines.  For example,
   consider this custom text:
</p>
<div class="code">
game.setHighScores([
   "HIGHEST SCORES",
   "",                    // blank line marks a group boundary
   "GRAND CHAMPION", "MJR  9,234,567",
   "",
   "LJE  4,101,623", "SPJ  3,991,424",
   "",
   "BHG  3,401,331", "SJW  2,103,377",
   "",
   "CASTLE CHAMPION", "MJR", "7 CASTLES DESTROYED"
]);
</div>
<p>
   We've used blank lines to identify the group breaks.  When displayed,
   this will produce a series of screens like this:
</p>
<img class="example" src="highScoreExample.png">

<p>
   If you don't insert blank lines to delineate the groups, PinballY
   will still break the text up into screens of one to three lines
   each, but it'll be forced to pick the line groupings mechanically.
   It uses this procedure:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>For the alphanumeric display style, the text is broken
   up into groups of two lines.  If there's an odd number of
   lines, the first line is shown on its own.

   <li>For other display styles, if there are three lines or fewer,
   they're displayed as a group.  Otherwise, the text is broken
   up into two-line groups.  If there's an odd number of lines,
   the first line is shown on its own.
</ul>

<p>
   Note that this procedure will be applied even if you use line
   breaks, if the groups set off by your line breaks are too large.
   For example, if provide a group of four lines and then a blank
   line, the four lines will be displayed two at a time.  If there
   are no blank lines anywhere, the procedure is simply applied to
   the list as a whole.
</p>
<p>
   It's worth pointing out that this line break procedure wasn't
   created for Javascript's sake.  It was really designed around
   PinEMHi's output.   PinEMHi <i>usually</i> uses blank lines to
   set off groups of text that form "screens" - but not always,
   so PinballY has to break up PinEMHi's output in some cases.
   The procedure described above is just a heuristic that produces
   decent results for nearly all PinEMHi output.  For Javascript
   purposes, you don't have to rely on the heuristics; you can
   control the exact layout by inserting blank lines to specify
   the grouping you want.

<p>
   <b>Upper/lower case:</b>  It's generally better to use pure
   upper-case for the score information.  The DMD fonts
   include a few lower-case letters, but the low resolution
   makes it impossible to render many letters in lower-case, so
   some letters you write in lower-case will actually be rendered
   in upper-case.  That can make the results look weird if you mix
   cases.  The exception is the "typewriter" style used for
   EM games; that uses an ordinary Windows font, so mixed case
   will be fine there.
