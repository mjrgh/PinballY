<h1>MediaSyncEvent</h1>

<p>
   This Event subclass represents media synchronization events,
   which occur when a window loads new media due to a new game
   selection, after returning from a launched game session, or
   for any other reason.  Media synchronization events let you
   intervene in the media loading process (for example, you
   could change the image that a window loads, or prevent
   loading a particular video), and also can be used to 
   coordinate your own custom displays in a window (using
   <a href="DrawingLayer.html">Drawing Layers</a>, for example)
   with background media changes.
</p>

<p>
   The basic media sync event type comes in the following subtypes:
</p>
<ul>
   <a name="mediasyncbegin"></a>
   <li><b>mediasyncbegin:</b>  Fires when something happens that
   requires the window to check to see if new media should
   be loaded.  This is the first step in the media sync process,
   so at this point the system hasn't decided whether or not new
   media will actually be required, and hasn't searched for
   the appropriate media files yet.  This event can be canceled
   (using <a href="Event.html#preventDefault">preventDefault()</a>),
   which tells the window to skip the rest of the process,
   keeping the current background media unchanged.

   <a name="mediasyncload"></a>
   <li><b>mediasyncload:</b>  Fires after a <b>mediasyncbegin</b>
   event if the window determines that new media should be loaded.
   At this point, the window has resolved the media files,
   so the filenames are included in the event properties.
   You can intervene by changing the filenames in the event
   object, or by canceling the event entirely
   (using <a href="Event.html#preventDefault">preventDefault()</a>),
   which prevents any new media loading.
   <p>
      Immediately after your event handler returns, assuming
      you don't cancel the event, the system will attempt to
      load the media file.  Assuming this is successful,
      the on-screen transition effect (cross-fading from the
      old background media to the new background) will start
      almost immediately.  A <b>mediasyncend</b> event will
      follow when the transition effect completes, or
      if an error occurs trying to load the media file.
   </p>

   <a name="mediasyncend"></a>
   <li><b>mediasyncend:</b>  Fires when the sync process
   has finished, which is <i>either</i> just after the media
   file has been successfully loaded and the cross-fade
   transition effect has finished, <i>or</i> after the media
   load attempt failed or was canceled.  The <b>disposition</b>
   property of the event object indicates which of these
   outcomes occurred.
   
</ul>
<p>
   A <b>mediasyncbegin</b> event is always fired at the start of the
   process, and a <b>mediasyncend</b> always fires at the end
   of the process, no matter what the outcome.  You can count
   on these events being paired, so you can use the "done" phase to unwind
   any global state that you set up in the "begin" or "load" phase.
</p>
<p>
   Media sync events are fired on the window object representing
   the window that's loading a new background.  When a new game is
   selected, the system visits each window in sequence and loads
   its media, so the media sync events will occur in that same
   sequence.
</p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   This event type has all of the standard event properties and methods
   (see the <a href="Event.html">Event class</a>), plus the following:
</p>

<ul>
   <li><b>game:</b> A <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object
   representing the current game, which determines which media files
   will be loaded.  If no game is selected, this is null.  This
   is provided in all phases of the event.

   <li><b>disposition:</b> For <b>mediasyncend</b> only, this is
   a string indicating the outcome of the media sync attempt:
   <ul>
      <li><b>"success":</b> the new media file was loaded successfully
      <li><b>"error":</b> an error occurred loading the new media file
      <li><b>"skip":</b> the system decided that it wasn't necessary
      after all to load new media: no game was selected, or the correct media file
      was already being displayed, or Javascript canceled the process
   </ul>
   
   <li><b>video:</b> A string giving the name of the video file
   that the system has chosen to use as the new background, or null
   if no video file for the game could be resolved.  This is only provided
   for the <b>mediasyncload</b> event.  You can change this value to
   override the system's choice of file with your own.

   <li><b>image:</b> A string giving the name of the image
   file that the system has chosen, or null if no image file for
   the game could be resolved.  This is only provided for the
   <b>mediasyncload</b> event.  You can change this value to override
   the system's choice of file with your own.

   <li><b>defaultVideo:</b> A string with the name of <i>default</i>
   video file to use as the background, as a fallback to the
   <b>video</b> and <b>image</b> files.  This is only provided for
   the <b>mediasyncload</b> event.  You can change this value to
   override the system's choice of file with your own.
   
   <li><b>defaultImage:</b> A string with the name of <i>default</i>
   image file to use as the background, as a fallback to the
   <b>video</b> and <b>image</b> files.  This is only provided for
   the <b>mediasyncload</b> event.  You can change this value to
   override the system's choice of file with your own.

</ul>
<p>
   All of the file properties (image, video, defaultImage, defaultVideo)
   contain complete Windows filenames, with drive letter, folder path, and
   extension.  If you change any of these, you must also use
   the same absolute path format, since PinballY will simply pass
   these strings to Windows directly to attempt to open the named
   files.  You can set any of these to null to remove it from
   consideration.
</p>
<p>
   The reason that multiple file properties are present is that the
   system treats these four as a series of back-up options if
   any of them can't be found or if any errors occur trying to
   load them.  The system visits the files in the following order,
   stopping at the first one that successfully loads:
</p>
<ul class="compact">
   <li>video
   <li>image
   <li>defaultVideo
   <li>defaultImage
</ul>
<p>
   If <b>video</b> is missing (meaning that the system couldn't
   find any video files in the Media folder for the game), or if an
   error occurs when PinballY attempts to load the video file
   (e.g., the file doesn't contain valid video data, or can't be
   opened for some reason), the system moves on to <b>image</b>
   as the next best candidate.  If no image file was found for
   the game, or an error occurs loading the file, PinballY
   next tries <b>defaultVideo</b>, and finally <b>defaultImage</b>.
</p>
<p>
   Note that video playback can be disabled by the user as an
   option setting.  When videos are disabled, the <b>video</b>
   and <b>defaultVideo</b> properties won't be present, since
   the system doesn't consider those as candidates for the
   background media.
