<h1>LaunchEvent</h1>

<p>
   Events of this class are fired to track the progress of a game session
   when the user launches a table.  This event has the following subtypes:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><b>prelaunch:</b>  Fired just before a game is about to be launched.
   This event occurs before any part of the launch process begins, so
   you can cancel the event (via <a href="Event.html#preventDefault">preventDefault()</a>)
   to prevent the launch.  This event also has the unique ability to
   modify anything about the command line that will be used to launch
   the game, including the executable path and command-line options,
   by setting properties of the <b>overrides</b> object in the event
   object (explained below, under the event properties).  For example,
   you can use <b>overrides</b> to add special command-line parameters
   that depend upon the particular game being launched or the command
   that was used to launch it.

   <li><b>gamestarted:</b>  Fired when PinballY detects that the launched
   game has successfully started and opened a window.  The exact timing of
   the event isn't predictable, since the game program runs as a separate
   Windows process.  You can count on the event firing some time after
   the game has opened its first window, but be careful not to assume
   that the game is actually ready to play, from the player's perspective.
   The first window the program opens might not be the game's actual
   "playfield" window.  Visual Pinball, for example, always
   opens its editor window first, before displaying the game window,
   so this event usually fires for VP well before the game is ready
   to play.  There's unfortunately nothing we can do in general to
   detect when the game is actually ready, since that's too dependent
   on the inner workings of the pinball player system.  If you want to
   wait until the game is truly ready to play, a simple heuristic
   might be to use a timeout to add a short delay, which you can
   gauge by trial and error for the games you play most frequently.
   If you're
   writing this event handler for a situation where you know you're
   working with a particular player system, you could potentially
   use low-level Windows APIs to communicate and coordinate with
   the game process, but short of that, there's not much we can do.
   This event can't be canceled, since it's fired after the fact.

   <li><b>gameover:</b>  Fired after PinballY detects that the child
   game process has terminated, and before any of the post-launch tasks
   (such as the game system's "Run After" commands) have been executed.
   This event can't be canceled, since it's fired after the game process
   has already exited.  (You can prevent PinballY from trying to stop
   the game in the first place, by blocking the "Kill Game" command via
   the <a href="CommandEvent.html">command</a> event.  That obviously
   doesn't prevent the game process from exiting on its own, or from
   the user taking an external action outside of PinballY that ends the
   game process, such as closing its window with the mouse or killing
   the process via Task Manager.  The <b>gameover</b> event fires
   regardless of what caused the process to terminate; it's just a
   notification that PinballY detected that the process exited.)

   <li><b>launcherror:</b>  Fired if a game launch fails.  This event
   is mutually exclusive with <b>gamestarted</b> and <b>gameover</b>,
   since those events will only be fired if the game successfully
   starts running; a <b>launcherror</b> event means that the launch
   attempt was unsuccessful, so no further action on the launch will
   occur.  You can cancel this event to prevent the error message
   from being displayed (canceling it has no other effect, though,
   as the event fires after the launch attempt has already failed).

   <li><b>postlaunch:</b>  The counterpart of <b>prelaunch</b> that
   fires at the very end of the launch procedure, after the game
   has exited and all of the "after game" tasks have been completed.

   <li><b>runafter:</b>  Fired after the game has exited, with the
   "Game Exiting" message displayed in the main PinballY window.
   This runs just after the external "Run After" command defined for
   the system runs.  This event can't be canceled.

   <li><b>runafterpost:</b>  Fired after the <b>runafter</b> event
   completes and the main PinballY window is blanked.  This event
   cannot be canceled.

   <li><b>runbefore:</b>  Fired just before the game program is
   launched, with the main PinballY window displaying the "Loading
   Game" message.  Canceling this event aborts the launch.

   <li><b>runbeforepre:</b>  Fired before the <b>runbefore</b>
   event, with the main PinballY window showing a blank, black
   background.  Canceling this event aborts the launch.
</ul>

<h2>Launch event sequence</h2>

<p>
   The process of launching a game has many steps, which is why
   the launch event has such a large number of subtypes.  Here's how
   all of these events get fired in the course of a game launch.
</p>

<p>
   The <b>runbeforepre</b>, <b>runbefore</b>, <b>runafter</b>, and
   <b>runafterpost</b> events run in that order, and correspond to the
   similarly named external commands that can be set up for each system
   in the options.  The separate "pre" and "post" events are provided
   for finer control over the display appearance during each step.
   During the <b>runbeforepre</b> and <b>runafterpost</b> commands, the
   main PinballY window is blank, showing just a uniform black
   background.  This makes it a good time to perform any changes
   to the physical monitor layout, such as rotating the monitors or
   changing the screen resolutions, since the blank window won't
   show any obvious visual effect and thus will help achieve
   a visually seamless transition to the new layout.
</p>
<p>
   For a successful launch, the full order of the events, including the
   external commands, is as follows:
</p>
<ul class="compact">
   <li><b>prelaunch</b> fires
   <li>The main PinballY window is blanked
   <li>The game system's external "Run Before Pre" command runs
   <li><b>runbeforepre</b> fires
   <li>The "Loading Game" message is displayed in the main window
   <li><b>runbefore</b> fires
   <li>The game system's external "Run Before" command runs
   <li>The game launches
   <li><b>gamestarted</b> fires
   <li>The game runs until the user quits
   <li>The "Game Exiting" message is displayed in the main window
   <li><b>gameover</b> fires
   <li>The game system's external "Run After" command runs
   <li><b>runafter</b> fires
   <li>The main window is blanked
   <li><b>runafterpost</b> fires
   <li>The game system's external "Run After Post" command runs
   <li><b>postlaunch</b> fires
</ul>
<p>
   <b>Error handling:</b>
   The sequence above is for successful launches.  Launches involve
   a lot of external moving parts, obviously, so there are many places
   where something can fail.  If an error occurs, the event sequence
   will change accordingly:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>If the game system launch itself fails (for example, if the game
   program can't be started, or if it terminates or crashes before opening a
   UI window), a <b>launcherror</b> event will be fired instead of
   <b>gamestarted</b> and <b>gameover</b>.
   
   <li>If a Run Before command fails, the launch will be cut short
   at that point in the sequence, without attempting to launch
   the game.

   <li>If a given Run Before step is executed successfully, the system
   tries to ensure that the corresponding Run After step is also executed,
   no matter what else went wrong along the way.  The Run After steps might
   need to undo global changes made in the paired Run Before steps, so it's
   important that these get executed even if other launch errors occur, so
   that everything's in its proper state to return to the PinballY wheel UI.

</ul>



<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>
   Launch events include all of the standard event properties and methods (see the
   <a href="Event.html">Event</a> class), plus the following:
</p>

<ul>

   <li><b>command:</b>  The <a href="Commands.html">command ID</a> of the
   command used to launch the game, typically command.PlayGame or
   command.CaptureGo.

   <li><b>error:</b>  For a <b>launcherror</b> event only, this is a string
   describing the error.  This message is normally displayed to the user
   via a popup message, but you can prevent that by canceling the event.

   <li><b>game:</b>  A <a href="GameInfo.html">GameInfo</a> object describing
   the game being launched.

   <li><a name="overrideProperties"></a><b>overrides:</b>
   For <b>prelaunch</b> only, this is initially set to
   an empty object.  Event listeners can set properties of this object to
   override the normal launch parameters taken from the game system's
   settings in the options.  The following properties can be set:

   <ul>
      <li><b>closeWindowName:</b> A string giving the window title to match
      when trying to terminate the game by closing its windows; see
      <a href="GameSysInfo.html#closeWindowName">closeWindowName</a>
      in the GameSysInfo object.

      <li><b>closeWindowNameIsRegex:</b> A boolean specifying whether
      <b>closeWindowName</b> is a literal string to match (false) or a
      regular expression pattern (true).  See
      <a href="GameSysInfo.html#closeWindowNameIsRegex">closeWindowNameIsRegex</a>
      in the GameSysInfo object.

      <li><b>closeWindowTimeout:</b> A number specifying the maximum waiting
      time, in milliseconds, after a "close window" command is sent to the game
      program when the user exits the game.  If this time limit is exceeded,
      and the game still hasn't exited, PinballY will try to terminate the game
      by killing its process.  See <a href="GameSysInfo.html#closeWindowTimeout">closeWindowTimeout</a>
      in the GameSysInfo object.

      <li><b>envVars:</b> Windows environment variables to pass to the
      game process.  This is a string with one or more variables, separated
      by semicolons (";"), with each variable using the format NAME=VALUE.
      If specified, this completely replaces the environment variables
      defined in the system settings, so if you want to keep those
      as well, you must explicitly include them in this property.
      
      <li><b>exe:</b>  A string giving the full filename with absolute path
      of the program executable (.EXE) to launch.
      
      <li><b>params:</b>  A string giving the command-line parameters to
      pass to the program executable.  This can contain the usual expansion
      variables in [square brackets]; see <a href="SystemOptions.html#parameters">Parameters</a>
      in the System Options dialog for the list of variables.

      <li><b>processName:</b>  A string giving the name of the process to
      monitor to determine when the game has terminated.

      <li><b>runAfter:</b>  A string giving the full command line to use as
      a replacement for the Run After command in the system's settings.

      <li><b>runAfterPost:</b>  A string giving the full command line to use as
      a replacement for the Run After Post command in the system's settings.

      <li><b>runBefore:</b>  A string giving the full command line to use as
      a replacement for the Run Before command in the system's settings.

      <li><b>runBeforePre:</b>   A string giving the full command line to use as
      a replacement for the Before Pre command in the system's settings.

      <li><b>swShow:</b>  An integer value giving the initial window mode;
      typically SW_SHOW, SW_SHOWMINIMIZED, or SW_HIDE.

      <li><b>terminateBy:</b>  A string giving the termination mode for the
      program; see <a href="GameSysInfo.html#terminateBy">terminateBy</a>
      in the GameSysInfo object.

      <li><b>workingPath:</b>  A string giving the full absolute path to use
      as the working directory for the game process.
      
   </ul>
