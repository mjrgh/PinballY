  Note: the "Min" versions are deprecated, since it was too difficult
  to figure out whether you needed the full or Min version.  The build
  script still builds them, but I no longer upload them.  For reference,
  the Min files are:
    Builds\PinballY-Min-xxxxxx.zip  [do not upload]
    Builds\PinballY-64bit-Min-xxxxxx.zip  [do not upload]

- git commit -a -m "check-in message"

- git push

- git tag X.Y.Z-LevelN

- git push origin --tags

- If desired, create a release on github/PinballY from the same binaries
  uploaded to mjrnet.org
