	//
	// The config tool uses these named states for two purposes.  One is

	// guarantee that some table's ROM name won't start with PBY, but it's
	// pretty unlikely.  Table ROM names are essentially arbitrary, but the
	// normal convention is to use a short abbreviation of the table name.

	// PinballX/front-end configuration uses ROM names to trigger table-
	// specific effects when a game is selected in the menu UI, but the
	// menu UI might only know the title of the table.  SwissLizard ran
	// into this issue when writing the PinballX plugin, and his solution
	// was to use a table title/ROM mapping table generated by the Config
	// Tool to look up the ROM based on title.  Now, DOF and the Config
	// Tool don't actually care about the ROMs qua ROMs; what we're
	// really doing here is coming up with a unique ID for each table 
	// that DOF and the menu system can agree upon, based upon the human-
	// readable table title.  
	//
	// The snag in this approach is that the human-readable titles in 
	// the front-end table list are also human-written, so there can be
	// some superficial variation in the exact rendering of the names,
	// of the sorts common to human-written text: capitalization, 
	// article elisions, misspellings, etc.  So rather than matching the
	// title strings as exact literal matches, we use "fuzzy matching",
	// which allows for approximate matches.
	//
	// The DOF PBX plugin actually implements fuzzy matching for titles
	// that does exactly what we're doing here.  It would have been
	// better design for DOF to have implemented that code as a core
	// service that could be exported through the DOF COM object as
	// well as the PBX plugin, but unfortunately it wasn't implemented
	// that way, so we have to provide our own similar implementation.
	//
	// Because of the need for fuzzy matching to the DOF mapping table,
	// we store the mapping table as a simple list of title/ROM pairs.
	// There are ways to index fuzzy-matched data more efficiently than
	// a linear search, but we have a small data set, so I don't think
	// it's worth the trouble.  However, we do at least pre-compute the
	// bigram set for each title string, which is what the fuzzy
	// matching algorithm uses to compute the similarity to a subject
	// string.  The bigram computation is relatively time-consuming,
	// so it makes the search process much faster if we pre-compute it 
	// for each string in the index.

	// SimplifyTitle() function.  This removes extra spaces and
