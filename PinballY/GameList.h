// work as expected, but we use a separate mechanism (through our
// separate statistics database file) to store new category

	// in the configuration.  When this is false, we'll ask the user
	// via an interactive menu if they wish to approve running this
	// system in Admin mode whenever we encounter a need to do so.  
	// The "need to do so" arises when the user attempts to launch
	// a game with this system, and our CreateProcess() call fails
	// with an "elevation required" error.  That happens when the
	// system's .exe's manifest contains a requested privilege level 
	// of "require administrator", and our own process isn't itself
	// running in Admin mode, and UAC is enabled on the system.
	// If the user approves the elevation, we record that approval
	// here for the rest of the current session, so that subsequent
	// attempts to run games with the same system don't have to
	// repeat the prompt - we assume that if the user trusts this
	// system on the first run, they'll continue to trust it
	// throughout the current session, so further security prompts
	// would be redundant and annoying.
	//
	// Two things to note.  First, the manifest privilege level
	// "highestAvailable" WON'T trigger an elevation request,
	// because we coerce the child to run as a normal user when we
	// encounter that request level.  That's different from the
	// normal shell and CreateProcess() behavior, but it's safer
	// and more suitable for a game system.  Elevation will only
	// some play when a manifest calls for administrator mode only.
	// Second, we can elevate multiple invocations of the same
	// system .exe (or even of different system .exe's) with only
	// one actual UAC prompt, because we use separate proxy process
	// that runs in elevated mode itself to carry out the actual
	// launches of the admin subprocesses.  That reduces the
	// annoyance level considerably because we don't have to
	// trigger a separate UAC dialog on every launch - just the
	// initial proxy launch.  We still display our own UAC-like
	// security warning on each launch of a new system, since we
	// obviously don't want to take a user's trust in one system
	// to imply that same trust applies to any other systems.  But
	// we do assume that a system trusted once remains trusted, so
	// we limit these per-system warnings to once per system per
