# Log file features.  PinballY writes certain information to a log file
# as it runs ("PinballY.log", in the PinballY install folder).  This is
# a simple human-readable text file with information on certain events 
# that occur as the program runs, with some internal details of the
# program's operation.  The idea is to store away some additional
# information that would be too technical and unfriendly to report in
# the graphical UI, but that are occasionally useful for troubleshooting
# purposes.  The main UI intentionally tries to hide a lot of technical
# detail for the sake of a friendly and game-like playing experience,
# but when something goes wrong, it's nice to have a more transparent
# view of the inner workings of the program.

# If you enter an "absolute" path (starting with a driver letter, X:\...),
# that exact folder is used with no changes.
#
# If the path starts with "[PinballX]" (e.g., [PinballX]\Media), the folder

# Should PinballY automatically launch at system startup?

# "off" means that the program doesn't launch automatically.  Use this
# setting if you want to run it manually from the Windows desktop each
# time you want to use it.
#
# "on" means that the program will launch automatically each time you
# log in to Windows.  PinballY will arrange for this by updating the
# following registry key:
#
# HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run[PinballY]
#
# "admin" means that the program will launch automatically in Administrator
# mode each time you log in.  This creates a Windows Task Scheduler entry 
# for you named "PinballY Startup Task".  The Task Scheduler entry is used
# instead of the registry key in this case because the registry key doesn't
# allow for Admin mode launches.

# IMPORTANT:  Unlike most settings, this setting can't be updated by 
# editing the Settings.txt file manually.  You must use the Options dialog
# to update this setting, because the setting has to be 
AutoLaunch = off

# Autolaunch delay time, in seconds.  When launch at startup is enabled,
# the launch is delayed after you log on by this amount of time.  This
# can be used to avoid conflicts with other programs that are also 
# launched when you log on, by sequencing the program launches so that
# they don't all start at the same time.  It's usually desirable to
# make sure that PinballY runs last when launching other programs, for
# a couple of reasons.  One is that other programs can thrash the disk
# while loading, which can make video playback jumpy; making PinballY
# wait until other programs have finished loading can make the initial
# video playback smoother.  Another is that the most recently launched
# program usually has control of keyboard focus, so if another program
# launches after PinballY, it can steal away the keyboard focus, which
# can prevent PinballY from responding to button presses.  Delaying
# PinballY's startup until after other programs have finished loading
# can make sure that PinballY has the initial keyboard focus.
AutoLaunch.Delay = 0


# Should we force keyboard focus into the PinballY window at program
# startup?  On some systems (particularly Windows 10), Windows doesn't
# give PinballY keyboard focus when launching it at system startup, so
# it won't accept keyboard input until you use the mouse to click in
# the window.  We can try to work around that by simulating a mouse
# click in our window automatically.  This option enables a simulated
# mouse click at the given delay after the program starts.  The delay
# might be necessary to wait for other activity at system startup to
# settle down, since other programs that are starting up at the same
# time might try to "steal" focus away from us the same way we're
# trying to grab it here.  The delay is given in seconds.

# Should we wait for monitors to come online at startup?  Most pin cabs
# have multiple monitors, and on many pin cabs, these are regular TVs rather 
# than computer monitors.  One of the little snags using TVs as monitors is
# that Windows can be slow to recognize them at system startup.  In fact,
# this process can be so slow that Windows can finish booting and can start
# launching programs before all of the TVs have been recognized.  This can
# cause screen layout problems for a program like PinballY that launches at
# startup, because it might not be possible to restore the saved window
# layout if some of the windows are located on screens that are still
# off-line.
#
# This option offers a way to work around that problem.  This lets you
# tell PinballY that it should wait, when first starting up, until Windows 
# has recognized all of your monitors.  PinballY won't open any of its
# UI windows until the system reports that all of your monitors are
# on-line.
#
# This string should use this format:
#
# <N> monitors, <S> seconds
#
# <N> monitors tells the program that it should wait at startup until
# Windows has recognized at least that many monitors.  Specify a maximum
# waiting time with <S> seconds.
#
# The program displays a little dialog box during the wait, with a Cancel
# button that lets you manually cancel the wait if desired.  So you can 
# set safely set a long wait time if necessary to accommodate monitors 
# with unpredictable startup times, in that you can always cancel the
# wait if necessary.
#
WaitForMonitors = 1 monitor, 10 seconds

# Additional wait time after the monitors are online, in seconds.
# Some video cards have a quirk where they appear in Windows as soon
# as an attached TV is powered on, but then disappear again briefly
# while the physical connection (e.g., HDMI) is established.  This
# added delay can be used in such cases, to ensure that PinballY
# doesn't try to open any windows during that connection interval.
WaitForMonitors.ExtraDelay = 0

# Force windows into the valid desktop area at startup?  If this is
# true, PinballY will check the saved position for each window that's
# initially displayed to make sure that it's within the visible area
# of the desktop.  Any window that's entirely off the screen will be
# repositioned so that it's within the visible area of the nearest
# monitor to the saved location.
#
# This is enabled by default to ensure that windows don't fall off
# the edge of the visible area after a change to the desktop layout.
# If you rearrange your desktop layout or change monitor resolutions
# between PinballY sessions, the saved positions from the last session
# might place some windows in parts of the screen that aren't visible
# in the new session.  That can be confusing because it'll look like
# the window has disappeared, when it's actually there, just beyond
# the bounds of the visible desktop area.
#
# You might want to disable this option if you change your desktop
# layout dynamically for different applications using an external
# tool.  In that case, it can appear to PinballY during program
# startup that the saved window positions are invalid, so if this
# option is enabled, PinballY can think it needs to reposition some
# of your windows into the apparently valid desktop area.  Disabling
# this option tells PinballY to restore the old window positions
# unconditionally, preserving your old layout.
#
Startup.ForceWindowsIntoView = 1

# Method for restoring full-screen windows at program startup.
# When PinballY starts up, it restores window positions saved in the
# settings file.  For windows that were set to full-screen mode, there
# are two ways to restore the saved position, which can be selected
# via this setting:
#
# "Nearest Monitor": this is the default.  This means that PinballY
# saves the PRE-full-screen position of the window - that is, the
# position of the original window just before you switched it into
# full-screen mode.  PinballY restores the full-screen window by
# first restoring that PRE-full-screen position, then finding the
# monitor that most completely contains the window (the "nearest"
# monitor), and expanding the window to fill that monitor.
#
# "Pixel Coordinates": In this mode, PinballY simply saves the pixel
# coordinates of the full-screen window itself, and restores those
# exact coordinates when the program starts.  It doesn't try to fit
# the position to a monitor.
#
# The "Nearest Monitor" method is more flexible, because it
# automatically adapts to any changes you make to the resolution
# settings or layout of your monitors.  When the program starts,
# PinballY looks at the CURRENT monitor layout, and finds a 
# suitable monitor to use as the full-screen monitor.  However,
# this might not be ideal for you if you routinely make TEMPORARY
# changes to your monitor setup, because it might move your windows
# around in the different resolution modes.  One case in particular
# where this can happen is if you use remote desktop access software
# to log into your PC remotely, since remote access software tends
# to virtualize the monitor layout.  If you have problems with 
# saving and restoring the positions of full-screen windows, try 
# the "Pixel Coordinates" method.
Startup.FullScreenRestoreMethod = Nearest Monitor


# Splash screen.  If true (1), the program displays a "splash screen"
# briefly at program startup, showing the program name and version.
# Set to false (0) to disable this.
SplashScreen = 1


# Mouse hiding.  PinballY hides the mouse pointer at program startup, 
# and again whenever you press a command button.  Normally, it does
# this using a standard Windows "hide the mouse" command.  But for
# reasons not yet understood, this standard command doesn't work on
# some systems.  So we offer this alternative for systems where the
# mouse refuses to be hidden: instead of hiding the pointer, we move
# it to a parking position at a corner of the screen where it won't
# be visible, or if that's not possible, where it at least won't be
# in the way.  Set Mouse.HideByMoving to 1 if you want to enable this
# alternative way of hiding the mouse, and set Mouse.HideCoords to
# the screen coordinates in pixels where you want the mouse to be
# parked.

# DOF.  PinballY can use DOF to activate effects on your pin cab 
# feedback devices, such as firing the flipper solenoids when you 
# press the flipper buttons and showing lighting effects when switching
# between games.  The program detects and accesses DOF automatically,
# using DOF's registered COM objects, so there's nothing extra that
# you have to install or configure to make DOF work with PinballY.
#
# The specific DOF effects that PinballY triggers are controlled by
# the DOF config files.  Most people set these up using the online
# DOF Config Tool, https://configtool.vpuniverse.com/.  PinballY
# pretends to be yet another pinball game as far as DOF is concerned,
# so PinballY's effects can be customized just any table's effects
# can be customized.  PinballY's pretend table name in the DOF
# config is "PinballY".  If you're using the online DOF Config tool,
# you can find the PinballY settings by clicking the Table Configs
# tab in the top nav bar, then selecting "PinballY" from the Table
# Name drop list.
#
# PinballY's DOF events are "virtual" events, with names starting
# with $PBY.  For a full list of these events, refer to the Help

#
# Set RealDMD as follows:

# can't be found.  Use this for troubleshooting if you think the DLL
# is installed but nothing is happening on the DMD device.
#
# RealDMD = Off - disables the real DMD, even if the DLL exists.
#
# If you haven't already done so, install Visual Pinball, and check that
# it works properly with your DMD device.  PinballY will use your Visual
# Pinball installation to access the DLL that interfaces with the device,
# so no additional configuration should be required for PinballY.
#
# Special case only: If for some reason you DON'T plan to install Visual
# Pinball, but still want to use the DMD with PinballY, you can install
# the appropriate DmdDevice.dll for your device directly in the PinballY
# program folder.  You should be able to get the right DLL from your

#
# In order to use .swf files, the Adobe Shockwave Flash Player ActiveX

# downloadable Media Packs for HyperPin including instruction cards
# in SWF format.  Those old Media Packs are still around and they're
# still the most convenient way to get all of the media "extras" for

# the Exit button to bring up this menu in the first place, so that's
# where your finger is poised while operating the menu.  As a result, I
# always found PinballX's treatment of it as the Cancel button, even in
# this context, to be irritating and wrong.  Granted, it's more 
# consistent overall to treat it as the Cancel button, since that's 
# how it acts everywhere else, but in my opinion this is one of those
# "foolish consistencies" that makes things worse rather than better.
# And even in terms of consistency, it's arguably more consistent in
# the local context of the Exit menu to treat it as "select".  But if
# you disagree and you prefer the old PinballX handling, just change
# this setting to Cancel.

# Button assignments.  Each button assignment uses syntax like
# this:
#
#   Button.<Name> = ...
#
# The button names and their meanings are listed below.  On the
# right side of the "=", you can assign one or more keyboard keys
# and/or joystick buttons to each function.  To map a keyboard
# key, use this syntax:
#
#   Button.<Name> = keyboard A
#
# Each key has a name; the alphabetic and number keys simply use
# their normal keyboard symbols, and most of the special function
# keys use the names printed on the key: Escape, Tab, Enter, etc.
# All of the "modified" keys (Shift, Control, Alt, Windows) come
# in left and right versions: LShift, RShift, LControl, etc.
#
# To map a joystick button, use this syntax:
#
#   Button.<name> = joystick * 7
#
# That maps button 7 on any joystick.  If you have multiple
# joysticks, and you want to tie a button to a particular joystick,
# that gets a bit tricker.  Change the * to a "logical joystick"
# unit number, then add a separate entry to the config like this:
#
#   JoystickDevice[N] = VID:PID:Product Name
#
# Where N is the logical joystick number you used above (you
# should number these consecutively from 0), VID and PID are the
# USB Vendor ID and Product ID for your joystick, and Product Name
# is the product name string for your joystick.  I'd recommend
# just using the * notation and ignoring all of this!

# The Service4 "Enter" button brings up the Setup menu, which lets
# you set global program options and set up tables.  This menus is
# only accessible from the service buttons for the same reason that
# the operator menus on a real pinball are only accessible from the
# service buttons, namely that it prevents guests from messing
# around with your configuration while still providing easy access
# to the owner, the difference being that the owner has the key to
# the coin door!  Once you're in the Setup menu, you can navigate
# it with the flipper buttons just like the other menus, or you can
# continue using the service buttons if you prefer.
#
# The Service1 "Exit" button cancels the current menu, if one is
# open, but it has a special extra function outside of menus: it

# If you want a blank message, use a single space character as the

# "first", then a blank message, then "last", then repeat.

#
#   [Game.Title]   - title of currently selected game
#   [Game.Manuf]   - manufacturer of current game
#   [Game.Year]    - release year of current game
#   [Game.System]  - system of current game (Visual Pinball, etc)
#   [Filter.Title] - current filter name ("All Tables", "70s Tables")
#   [Filter.Count] - number of games in the current filter set
#   [Credits]      - number of "credits" from inserted coins
#   [lb]           - literal left square bracket ("[")
#   [rb]           - literal right square bracket ("]")

# The word after the first colon is used as the expansion if the 
# count is 1, so this gives you the singular form.  The word after 
# the second colon is selected if the count is greater than one.  
# The word after the third colon is used if the count is zero.
# The third "zero" variation is optional; the plural form is used 
# if it's not specified.  So {Filter.Count:Table:Tables:Tablez} 
# expands to "Table" if the filter count is 1, "Tables" if it's
# greater than 1, or "Tablez" if it's 0.  In English, you only
# need the first two for grammatical agreement, since zero is
# grammatically plural in English ("0 things").

# Game Wheel auto-repeat rate.  When you press and hold one of
# the wheel navigation buttons (Next, Previous, Next Page,
# Previous Page), the button auto-repeats as long as you hold
# it down, so that you can rapidly step through games on the
# wheel.  This controls the rate of the repeats.
#
# By default, if you leave this empty, the wheel button repeat
# rate is simply the same as the Windows keyboard repeat rate.
# You can change this to a different rate here.  You can also
# use this to set up a custom speed "ramp" that gradually
# increases or decreases the speed the longer you hold down
# the button.
#
# Specify the repeat rate as a list of timing entries separated
# by commas.  Each entry is the time between repeats for that
# "step" in the list.  When you press one of the navigation
# buttons, the wheel will immediately turn one game (or page)
# in that direction.  It'll then wait for the first time step
# in this list and turn one more time, then wait for the second
# time step and turn again, and so on.  The last step in the
# list is then repeated for as long as you hold down the
# button.
#
# Each time step is simply a number of milliseconds, but you
# can say so explicitly with the units "ms", as in 250ms.  You
# can also express the time in seconds if you prefer by using
# the unit "s", as in 0.25s.
#
# As a really simple example, this sets up a fixed repeat rate
# that switches games every 1/4 second (250 milliseconds):
#
#  wheel.AutoRepeatRate = 250ms
#
# PC keyboards usually have a slight delay before auto-repeat
# kicks in.  You can achieve that by listing two time steps in
# the repeat rate.  The first step says how long to wait before
# the first repeat, and the second step says how long to wait
# between subsequent repeats.  For example, if you want to
# wait half a second before the first repeat and then repeat
# every 1/10 of a second, you could write this:
#
#  wheel.AutoRepeatRate = 500ms, 100ms
#
# You can get even more elaborate.  Say you want the repeat
# rate to start slow and then gradually speed up the longer
# you hold down the button.  Let's start at 500ms for the
# first repeat, and then gradually speed up over the next
# several repeats until we get to 100ms between repeats:
#
#  wheel.AutoRepeatRate = 500ms, 400ms, 300ms, 200ms, 100ms
#
# The last time listed is applied to all subsequent repeats
# after reaching that point, so the instructions above will
# continue repeating at 100ms intervals as long as you hold
# down the button.
#
# One more detail: for each time item, you can optionally
# specify the number of times to repeat that interval, by
# adding an asterisk (*) and the number of repeats:
#
#  wheel.AutoRepeatRate = 500ms*4, 100ms
#
# That performs the first four repeats at 500ms intervals,
# then speeds up to 100ms intervals after that.
#
# If you leave this blank, PinballY uses your keyboard auto-
# repeat rate, as you have it currently set up in the Windows
# control panels.  You can also use those time settings
# explicitly using the special terms KbRate and and KbDelay
# in the time list.  KbDelay is the initial delay time before
# the first repeat as set in your Windows settings, and KbRate
# is the repeat rate after the initial delay.  PinballY's
# default settings are thus equivalent to:

# Media capture setup.  The Game Setup menu lets you capture screen
# shots of a running game to use as the background images displayed
# in the menu system.  The system automatically uses your PinballY
# window layout as a proxy for the running game's window layout, so
# there's no need to configure the game window layout separately.
# The only thing you have to configure here is the timing of the
# capture process, and in some cases the audio capture device.
#
# The first parameter selects the audio capture device.  An audio
# capture device is required to capture the audio portion when
# recording screen captures; it's not needed if you just want to
# capture still screen shots or silent videos.  The capture device
# is a virtual Windows device that reads back the sound playing
# through your sound card's Line Out port.  You should find this
# device listed in your Windows Sound control panel under the
# Recording tab.  The device is commonly called "Stereo Mix" or
# some variation containing those words, but not always; the
# exact name is up to your sound card manufacturer.  Note that
# the Microphone or Line In inputs won't usually work for screen
# captures because they record from the physical line inputs; for
# screen capture recording, you need the "fake" device that reads
# back the Line Out audio.
#
# By default, if you leave this setting blank, PinballY will
# search through the list of all attached audio input devices for
# one containing the words "Stereo Mix" in the name.  That works
# on many systems, particularly with US localization, but doesn't
# work if your sound card manufacturer happened to choose a 
# different name for their equivalent of this device, OR if your
# system has a non-English localization, in which case the name
# of the device will probably be translated to your language.
# So if PinballY complains that no audio capture device is
# present when you try to do a capture with audio, you can fill
# in the correct name here.
#
Capture.AudioDevice =


# The rest of the capture parameters control the timing of the
# capture process.
#
# The first timing parameter is how long to wait for the game to
# start up.  You'll want to give it enough time to enter "Attract
# Mode" in the game, where it's ready to begin a game.  That is,
# long enough to load into VP (or whatever system) and go through
# the game's ROM startup/test process.  The actual ROM startup
# time varies a lot by game, so adjust this as needed if you
# encounter games that aren't ready in time.  The delay time is
# given in seconds.
Capture.StartupDelay = 10

# Manual start/stop buttons.  For media items set to manual
# start or manual stop, the capture starts when you press this
# button or button combination.  This can be one of the following:
#
#   flippers      press both flipper buttons (the buttons 
                  assigned to the "Next" + "Previous" commands)
#
#   magnasave     press both Magna Save buttons ("Next Page" +
#                 "Previous Page")
#
#   launch        the button assigned to the Launch command
#
#   info          the button assigned to the Info command
#
#   instructions  the button assigned to the Instructions command
#
Capture.ManualStartStopButton = flippers

# Each time a capture is started, we show a message by default
# explaining how the PinballY window layout determines the screen
# capture area.  The message offers an option to skip the message
# on future captures.  This variable indicates that the user has
# chosen the "skip" option.
Capture.SkipLayoutMessage = 0

# Capture timing for individual media types. 
#
# For each media type, you can select MANUAL or AUTO capturing:
#
# * AUTO means that the capture happens automatically as soon as
# the media type's turn comes up.  If you set everything to AUTO,
# the capture will proceed as a wholly automatic process without
# any action on your part.  
# 
# * MANUAL means that you have to press a button combination to 
# start and/or stop the capture for that media type.  This allows
# you to control the exact starting point and/or duration of the 
# capture for that item.
#
# All media types let you set the START time to AUTO or MANUAL.
# An automatic start time makes the capture for that item start
# as soon as that item is reached in the capture process.  For
# image types, that's the only timing needed.  For video and
# audio types, you can also set the STOP mode to AUTO or MANUAL.
# AUTO STOP mode means that the capture proceeds for the duration
# set by the TIME value for that type (in seconds), and then
# automatically stops.  MANUAL STOP means that the capture keeps
# going until you press the key combination to end that item.
#
# During the capture process, a status window appears that shows
# you the current item being captured, and prompts you to press
# the manual keys when necessary to start or stop the current
# item.
#
# Note that TIME values are ignored if STOP is set to MANUAL.

# Two-pass capture.  Normally, when capturing screen-shot video,
# we capture and encode (compress) the video in real time.  This
# requires a fairly fast CPU; slower machines might not be able
# to do the compression work quickly enough to keep up with the
# live video frame rate, so captured videos might have too many
# dropped frames, which will manifest see as momentary freezes 
# when the video is played back.  If your captured videos look
# choppy, try setting this to 1 to enable two-pass recording.
# In two-pass mode, we initially capture the video without any
# compression; even slower machines can usually handle this
# without dropping frames.  We then convert the captured video
# to a compressed format.  This takes long than doing it all
# in one operation, but it should produce smoother videos if
# your single-pass captures look too choppy.

# Captured video resolution limit.  By default, videos created
# using the screen capture function have exactly the same pixel
# dimensions as the window area being captured.  However, if you
# have a 4K monitor or another large-format computer monitor, you
# might find that the full-resolution videos are too taxing for
# your system to play back smoothly, especially if you have an
# older or lower-end system.  This option lets you limit the
# resolution of captured videos to a more manageable size that
# your system will be able to play back more smoothly.  Possible
# settings are:
#
#   none = no limit; the full native resolution will be used
#          (this is the default setting)
#
#   hd   = limit to HD resolution, 1920x1080 pixels
#
# Note that this only sets an upper limit on resolution.  When
# the source window is smaller than this limit, it'll still be
# captured at the smaller native resolution.  So if you have a
# 4K playfield monitor and a sub-HD backglass monitor, setting
# an HD limit will only affect the playfield videos.

# Coin slot pricing.  This is just a novelty feature for the sake
# of its entertainment value, as we don't have any real practical
# use for coins or credits.  We do deduct one credit for each game
# launch, but we don't require credits to launch - we'll launch a
# game even if the balance is zero.  But if we wanted to implement
# a "real" coin system, we wouldn't want to deduct credits when
# you merely launch a game from the menu; we'd instead want to
# transfer credits from the menu system to the games themselves,
# and then have the tables deduct credits on each play.  We don't
# have any way to transfer credits like that, so the use of coins
# in the menu is purely for the novelty value.
#
# If you want to disable this feature, simply omit the button
# assignments below, which will prevent any coin recognition.
#
# If you want to enable coin recognition, the first step is to set
# up your coin slot keyboard mappings.  If you have physical coin 
# slots with "coin mechs" installed, you'll want to set them up 
# for use with VP anyway, so it's a small extra step to enable 
# them here.  Simply list the keyboard keys or joystick buttons 
# that you've wired your coin slot switches to below, in the 
# Buttons.CoinN variable settings.  
#
# The standard button assignments are dictated by VPinMAME, which
# uses the following fixed key assignments:
#
#  "3" key -> first/left slot in a 2-slot coin door
#  "4" key -> second/middle slot, not used in a 2-slot door
#  "5" key -> third/right slot in a 2-slot door
#  "6" key -> fourth slot, or dollar bill acceptor in a US 2-coin door
#
Buttons.Coin1 = keyboard 3
Buttons.Coin2 = keyboard 4
Buttons.Coin3 = keyboard 5
Buttons.Coin4 = keyboard 6

# Now set the coin denomination for each slot.  The currency unit
# is whatever you want it to be.  In the US, you can use dollars,
# so .25 would represent a quarter.  But you could just as well 
# denominate this in Euros, Pounds, or arcade tokens.  When you
# insert a coin in one of the slots, PinballY will add the
# declared coin value for that slot to a running total "coin
# balance" it keeps internally.
Coin1.Value = .25
Coin2.Value = .25
Coin3.Value = .25
Coin4.Value = 1.00

# Finally, set the relationship between coin values and "credits".
# We use "credit" in the usual pinball sense of the word, where a
# credit gives you one play.  The UI reports everything in terms 
# of credits. 
#
# Most pinballs from the 90s and later have pricing where you get
# bonus credits for more coins, such as "one credit for 50 cents,
# 3 credits for $1".  To allow for this kind of pricing model, we
# let you list multiple coin value levels, and the corresponding
# number of credits.  You can enter as many of these levels as
# you like.  Each level is specified with an entry of the form
# <coin-value> <credits>.  For example:
#
#    .50 1
#
# That means that .50 currency units (Coin.Value units) gives you
# one credit.  List any number of these levels that you like, in
# ascending order, separated by commas.  The default setting sets
# up the typical modern US "50/75/$1" pricing, which is to say, 50 
# cents for one credit, 75 cents for two credits, $1 for three. 
# When we reach the end of the list, we simply start over, so in 
# our .50/.75/$1 example, inserting a fifth quarter takes you
# back to the .50/credit point.  
#
# Fractional credits can be used, expressed as floating point
# values:  e.g., 0.5 means a half credit.  You should only use
# halves and quarters for the sake of nice display formatting,
# as we can show 1/2, 1/4, and 3/4 as fractions in the UI;
# other fractions will be displayed less nicely as decimal
# values (e.g., if for some reason you want 1/6 credits, it
# would be displayed as .166667).
#
# The program keeps an internal counter of the total coin value
# inserted so far, and translates to credits accordingly.  The
# coin counter resets whenever the player launches a new game
# or exits, but the last credit balance is retained across
# sessions.  The program deducts one credit on each launch, if
# any credits are available, just to maintain the pretense that
# the credits are actually used for something.
#
# Sample pricing models:
#
# US 25 cents/play: .25 1
# US 50 cents/play: .25 .5, .50 1
# US 50c/75c/$1:    .25 .5, .50 1, .75 2, 1.00 3
# US 3 for $1:      .25 .5, .50 1, .75 1.5, 1.00 3
# US 75c/$2 x 3:    .75 1, 2.00 3
# US 50c/$2 x 5:    .25 .5, .50 1, .75 1.5, 1.00 2, 1.25 2.5, 1.50 3, 1.75 3.5, 2.00 5

# Hide the Windows taskbar while a game is running.  If you're using

# the principle is the same: if the real DMD is included here,
# we'll continue to show our image/video media on the real DMD

# Pinball systems.  Each system is specified via a set of "System<n>" 
# variables, explained below.  The "<n>" is just an arbitrary number to 
# identify the system within the configuration ("System1", "System2",
# etc).
#
#
# SystemN = Display Name
# This is the name displayed in the UI for this system.
#
# SystemN.MediaDir = subfolder
# The subfolder name to use for media files for this system's games.
# Media files are the images, videos, and sounds for the tables:
# the playfield images and backglass videos and so on.  Use only
# the subfolder name here, such as "Visual Pinball" - this is
# combined with the MediaPath variable to form the full path, so
# you only need the subfolder name here.  If you omit this, the
# display name of the system is used by default, as defined
# by the SystemN=xxx variable.
#
# SystemN.DatabaseDir = subfolder
# The subfolder name to use for the XML files that list the games
# for this system.  EACH SYSTEM MUST HAVE ITS OWN SEPARATE FOLDER
# THAT ISN'T SHARED BY ANY OTHER SYSTEMS, since this is how the
# program tells which system to use to launch each game.  If you
# omit this variable, the display name of the system (as defined 
# by the SystemN=xxx variable) is used as the folder name.
#
# SystemN.Enabled = true|false
# Specifies whether this game's systems appear in the UI.  The
# system's XML database files will simply be ignored if the system 
# is marked as disabled.  This defaults to true if omitted.
#
# SystemN.Class = system type:  type of system.  Set this to one
# of the following:
#
#   VPX    - Visual Pinball 10
#   VP     - Visual Pinball 9 or earlier
#   FP     - Future Pinball
#   STEAM  - Steam-based program (Pinball Arcade, Pinball FX2, etc)
#   Other  - Any other system [this is the default]
#
# Omit it for other systems.  If you set this, it lets PinballY use
# its special knowledge of VP or FP for this system's games.  It also
# lets PinballY supply defaults for some settings, so that you don't
# have to set up as much explicitly.
#
# SystemN.Exe = application executable (.exe) file with full path
# This is the executable that we launch when the user starts a table
# for this system.  In most cases, you should simply specify the
# full path and .exe file name.  Alternatively, you let PinballY
# find the executable based on the registry settings for the target
# system:
#
# - If you omit this entirely, and there's a DefExt setting for
#   this system, PinballY will use the program registered for that
#   file type.
#
# - If you use a filename with no path (e.g., VPinball995.exe),
#   PinballY will look for the registered program for the filename
#   extension given in DefExt for this system.  It will then combine
#   the PATH portion of that program with the filename you specified.
#   This is convenient if you have multiple versions of VP installed,
#   as long as you installed them all in the same folder, since it
#   looks up the folder path automatically.
#
# - If you set this to [STEAM] (with the square brackets), PinballY
#   will look in the registry for the installed Steam application,
#   and use that if found.
#
#
# SystemN.Parameters = command-line parameters for launching games
# This is a template for the command line sent to the EXE at launch.  
# You can use the following substitution variables in the string:
#
#   [TABLEPATH] = the path from SystemN.TablePath 
#   [TABLEFILE] = the filename of the table being launched
#   [LB]        = a literal left square bracket, [
#   [RB]        = a literal right square bracket, ]
#
# SystemN.Environment = environment variables to pass to the program
# This is a list of NAME=VALUE pairs, separated by semicolons (;).
# These values are merged into the parent environment that PinballY
# inherited from the Windows desktop when it was initially launched.
# Some game programs (such as Pinball Arcade) depend upon receiving
# additional information via the environment rather than through the
# normal command-line parameters.
#
#
# SystemN.ShowWindow = initial window mode for launched game
# This specifies how the game program's window is initially opened.
# Use one of the following values:
#
#   SW_SHOW          - shows the window normally
#   SW_SHOWMINIMIZED - shows the window minimized to the task bar
#   SW_HIDE          - hides the window
#
# Visual Pinball and Future Pinball work best with SW_SHOWMINIMIZED,
# because these programs show their "editor" windows initially, and
# you don't usually want to see those at all when playing.  Most
# other programs work best with SW_SHOW, which is the default.
# (You can actually use any of the internal Windows SW_SHOWxxx
# constant names here, which you can find in the Windows SDK
# documentation if you're that interested.  But the ones listed
# above should handle all of the known systems, so we're not
# listing the others here for the sake of brevity.)
#
#
# SystemN.Process = process name to monitor (XXX.EXE, with no path)
# This is mostly for games that run through Steam.  To run a Steam
# game, the application we launch via SystemN.Exe is STEAM.EXE, but
# that in turn launches a second executable that actually runs the
# game session.  That second exe is the one that we have to monitor
# for shutdown, and the one that we have to close if the user wants
# to exit back to PinballY.  Specify just the exe name here, without
# any path prefix.
#
# SystemN.TerminateBy = termination mode
# This specifies how PinballY should terminate the game program when
# you press the Exit Game button.  The possible settings are:
#
#   CloseWindow: this is the default.  PinballY will simply close all
#   of the game program's windows.  Most programs will exit on their
#   own when their windows are closed.  This is considered the safest
#   approach to ending a program, since it allows the program to save
#   files and clean up any system resources it's using before it exits.
#
#   KillProcess: asks Windows to terminate the process without the
#   program's cooperation.  This is what Task Manager uses when you
#   tell it to end a process.  This doesn't give the program a chance
#   to save files or release resources, so in some cases it can create
#   system stability problems, by leaving some system resources (such
#   as files or devices) locked or in otherwise dubious states.  This
#   should only be used if CloseWindow doesn't work reliably for this
#   system.
#
# SystemN.TablePath = full path to the folder where you store the
# table files for the system, such as Visual Pinball's .vpt files.
# If you specify a relative path (with no X:\ drive spec), the path
# is relative to the .EXE folder for the system.  This means you
# can simply set this to "Tables" for the standard VP setup, for
# example, without specifying the full path.  Use "." (a single
# period) to specify folder itself.  You can simply omit this for
# a system like The Pinball Arcade that doesn't use table files.
#
# SystemN.DefExt = default filename extension ("." suffix) for table files
# The launcher will add this to the table filenames in the table database 
# if necessary when generating the command line parameters.  You can
# simply omit this for a system like The Pinball Arcade that doesn't use 
# external table files.
#
# SystemN.StartupKeys = key sequence to send at startup
# This is designed especially for The Pinball Arcade, but could be used for
# any other game systems where the game itself has a startup menu that has
# to be navigated before play can begin.  TPA really complicates things in
# this regard because it has its own table menu: we have to navigate through
# its table menu to pick out the game that the user already selected from
# our table menu!  It's ridiculous, but TPA doesn't have a way to launch
# a particular game externally; it can only reach a game through its UI.
# So this option provides a way to automate that initial menu navigation.
# The StartupKeys entry is a list of keystrokes to send, separated by
# spaces.  You can use the following key names:
#
#   Up Down Left Right   [the arrow keys]
#   A through Z, 0 through 9  [letter and number keys]
#   LShift RShift LAlt RAlt LCtrl RCtrl  [shift/alt/control keys]
#   CapsLock NumLock
#   F1 through F12  [top-row function keys]
#   Dash Plus Backslash LBracket RBracket Comma Period Slash Colon Quote
#   Esc Tab Space Backspace
#
# In addition, the following special sequences can be used:
#
#   {comment} - everything between curly braces is ignored
#
#   [click] or [rclick] - send a left or right mouse click.  By default,
#   this clicks at the current mouse position, wherever that is.  You
#   can also specify a target window to click in, which positions the
#   mouse at the center of the target window just before clicking:
#   [click playfield], [click backglass], [click dmd], or [click topper].
#
#   [pace M] - set the pace in milliseconds.  The simulated keystrokes
#   after this point will be paced with a delay of M milliseconds
#   between keys.  This can be used if the receiver program doesn't
#   respond quickly enough to handle keys sent at full speed.
#
#   [pause N]  - pause for N seconds
#
#   [gridpos Down Right]  - send the Down Arrow and Right Arrow keys
#   enough times to move to the grid position given by the gridPos
#   entry for the game in the game database.  Make sure that the 
#   key sequence leading up to this point sets things up so that the
#   upper left icon (row 1, column 1) is selected, since the [gridpos]
#   element determines how many Down and Right keys to send based on
#   the assumption that we're starting from the upper left.
#
# For a system that requires a mouse click in its main window at startup
# to establish focus, use a StartupKeys string like this: [click playfield]
#
# SystemN.DOFTitlePrefix = prefix used in DOF table entries for this system
# The DOF table database uses prefixes in the game title to distinguish
# games that exist in multiple systems.  The DOF database considers VP to
# be the default system, so VP has no prefix.  Future Pinball uses "FP",
# PinballFX2 and FX3 use "FX2" and "FX3" respectively.
#
# SystemN.NVRAMPath = path to this system's "non-volatile RAM" files.  We
# use these files to retrieve high score lists, when available.  This only
# applies to VP and FP games, and you can normally omit it, because we can
# usually infer it automatically from the VPinMAME install location (for VP
# games) or the Future Pinball install folder (for FP games).  Please only
# use this if you have an unusual setup - it's better to use the defaults 
# if you can, because it's one less thing to keep track of if you ever 
# rearrange folder paths.
#
# SystemN.RunBeforePre = a command to run before the RunBefore command.
# (Yes, the name is awkward, but it seems better than RunBeforeBefore.)
# This command does essentially the same thing as RunBefore, but it has
# the important distinction that PinballY displays a completely blank,
# black screen in the playfield window while running this command.  This
# is a good place to put any command that changes the system-wide monitor
# layout, since the blank playfield window will help make the transition
# smoother by concealing the visual change.
#
# SystemN.RunBefore = a command to run just before launching a game using
# this system.  This is a command line of the sort that you could type into
# the Windows "Run" box.  Use the same rules as for the RunAtStartup option.
# You can use same substitution variables allowed in SystemN.Parameters (see
# above) in this command line.  You can also use the special prefix string
# [NOWAIT] if you want PinballY to launch the program as a background
# process and then immediately launch the game, without waiting for the
# RunBefore program to finish.  Without this prefix, PinballY waits for
# the RunBefore program to finish before launching the game.  Use [NOWAIT]
# if the program you're running is meant to continue running while the game
# is running.  If you want PinballY to explicitly terminate this program
# after the game exits, use [NOWAIT TERMINATE].
#
# SystemN.RunAfter = a command to run just after finishing a game using
# this system.  This is executed just after the game exits, before PinballY 
# takes over again.  Use the same command line syntax that you'd type into
# the Windows "Run" box.  You can use same substitution variables allowed in
# SystemN.Parameters (see above) in this command line.  Use [NOWAIT] if you
# want PinballY to return to resume immediately, without waiting for the 
# program to finish.  By default, PinballY will wait for this program to
# exit before returning to its normal user interface.
#
# SystemN.RunAfterPost = a command to run after the RunAfter command. 
# As with RunBeforePre, this command is executed with a blank, black
# screen shown in the playfield window, so it's a good place to put any
# command that changes the system-wide monitor layout.
#
# SystemN.ShowWindowsWhileRunning = a list of windows to keep open
# while games using this system are running.  This is a space-delimited
# list with the following window IDs: bg, dmd, topper, instcard.  An
# ID can be marked as explicitly NOT shown while running by preceding
# it with a hypen, so "-bg dmd" means that we hide the backglass and
# show the DMD.  Any windows not mentioned inherit the default settings
# from the global ShowWindowsWhileRunning setting, and individual games
# can override the system settings in their game details settings.

# Menu navigation for The Pinball Arcade to reach the selected game.  This is
# rather convoluted because we can't get any feedback on the UI's state, and
# more problematically, the initial state can vary.  The keystroke list below
# will undoubtedly have to be tweaked from time to time as Farsight revises 
# their UI.
#
# Since this is so convoluted, here's an explanation of the steps...
#
# The first thing we do is give the UI 25 seconds to start up.  It usually
# doesn't need quite this long, but it can on the first run after a reboot.
# Then we press the Enter key to get past the intro screen and into the menu.
#
# At that point, TPA sometimes likes to throw up an announcement dialog box,
# but not always.  Clicking the mouse dismisses the dialog, but if there's
# no dialog, clicking will select some random initial button selection
# on the menu instead.  So we pretend that there's no dialog and navigate
# up to the "Settings" icon at the top, and send a click.  If there was a
# dialog, the navigation will have no effect, but the click will dismiss
# the dialog and leave us at the main menu; if there wasn't a dialog,
# we'll be on the settings page.  In either case, we can now get to the
# grid by hitting Up to get the top row of icons, Left several times to
# make sure we're at the left end of the row, Right to get to the arcade
# icon, and click to enter the game grid.  Whee!
#
# Now that we're in the game grid, we have to get into the alphabetical
# list.  The grid retains its setting from the last run, so it could be
# sorted in some other order, in which case the game's grid position won't
# be the same.   When we enter this screen, the top left game will be
# selected.  Moving up one row takes us to the sorting options row, so
# we send an Up, then a bunch of Left keys to make sure we're at the
# first button in the row ("Alphabetical").  We send a click to select
# that.  Now we should have the grid in the right order, so we send a
# Down to move to the top left game, send send Down and Right keys to
# get to the target grid position.  Finally, we send a click to select
# that game icon.  That'll bring up a "play this game" dialog, so we
# pause to let the dialog load, and then send a click to load the game.

# of them to games in the future.  You don't have to edit this list by hand.
# It's just a place for the system to stash the information.  The list only

# in front of other windows, even when another window is the "active"
# window.
#
# This option is intended to make for smoother visual transitions during
# game launches, by preventing other application windows from popping
# into the foreground while waiting for the game to finish starting up.
# If you ever have problems with other random application windows coming
# into view during a game launch, this option might be helpful.  I've

# seems to want to rearrange windows during process creation in some

# cabs with three monitors, since the window ordering isn't a factor when

# a desktop environment or a two-monitor pin cab, you might want to place
# both windows on the same monitor.  This will ensure that the DMD window
# stays in front of the backglass window in such a setup.
#
# Note that this applies to the *PinballY* DMD window.  It doesn't have
# any effect on the Freezy dmd-extensions "virtual DMD" window.  dmd-ext
# is a whole separate program with its own configuration files, so you'll
# need to configure that window separately.  It also doesn't have any
