// Weak reference to a reference-counted object.  This manages a pointer
// reference that isn't counted in the referenced object, and thus doesn't
// keep the object alive.  Instead, we register with the referenced object
// for notification on deletion, so that we can clear our pointer.
//
// A weak reference requires a WeakRefable as the target.
//
// Since the target object can be deleted while one or more weak references
// to it still exists, callers holding weak refs must always check to see 
// if the reference is still valid each time they use the pointer.
//
// Internally, the weak reference is implemented via a proxy object.  The
// proxy is a reference-counted object that simply keeps a pointer to the
// target object.  The proxy is created by the target when the target is
// created, and the target keeps a counted reference on the proxy.  When
// the target is deleted, its destructor clears the pointer in the proxy
// and releases its reference on the proxy.  Each WeakRef on the target
// also keeps a counted reference to the proxy.  When we wish to 
// dereference a WeakRef, we simply get the pointer from the proxy.  If
// the target object still exists, the proxy will contain the pointer to
// it.  If the target has been deleted, the proxy's pointer will be null.
// The proxy itself is reference-counted, so it'll stay around as long as
// the target object or any WeakRefs to the target exist, and will be
// automatically deleted as soon as there are no such references.
